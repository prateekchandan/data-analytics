\
Prologue\
\
\
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.\
\
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.\
\
This planet has\'97or rather, had\'97a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.\
\
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\'92t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.\
\
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.\
\
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\'92d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move and that no one should ever have left the oceans.\
\
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\'e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.\
\
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever.\
\
This is her story.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 1\
\
\
That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year. It was cold and windy, which was normal.\
\
It started to rain, which was particularly normal.\
\
A spacecraft landed, which was not.\
\
There was nobody around to see it except for some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadn\'92t the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. So they did what they did to everything, which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked.\
\
It slipped down out of the clouds, seeming to be balanced on a single beam of light.\
\
From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close up to it was strangely beautiful\'97a gray craft of elegantly sculpted form; quite small.\
\
Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest Mid-Galactic Census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right.\
\
You\'92d probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and told nobody anything they didn\'92t already know\'97except that every single person in the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this was clearly not true the whole thing eventually had to be scrapped.\
\
The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights seeming to wrap it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum that became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb.\
\
At last it dropped and was quiet.\
\
A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself.\
\
A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within.\
\
A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under his arm.\
\
He turned and gave a single abrupt wave back to the ship. Already the rain was streaming through his hair.\
\
\'93Thank you,\'94 he called out, \'93thank you very\'97\'94\
\
He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought started quickly to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom.\
\
It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA-MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI. BE LIKE THE TWENTY-SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE\'97BARK!\
\
\'93Hold on!\'94 the figure called, waving at the ship.\
\
The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re-unfolded, and allowed him back in.\
\
He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag.\
\
He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had already begun its ascent.\
\
Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onward, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever-increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky.\
\
His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on.\
\
More lights.\
\
Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded.\
\
The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his steps, making directly toward the point on the horizon at which they had appeared.\
\
And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upward, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag over it before climbing over it himself.\
\
Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side than there came a machine sweeping out of the rain toward him with lights streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the machine streaked toward him. It was a low, bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing\'97sleek, gray, and rounded and moving at terrifying speed.\
\
The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night.\
\
It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared.\
\
To the figure\'92s apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read \'93My other car is also a Porsche.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 2\
\
\
Rob McKenna was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he\'92d had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everybody.\
\
He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear.\
\
The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls.\
\
It wasn\'92t that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped not. It was just the rain that got him down, always the rain.\
\
It was raining now, just for a change.\
\
It was a particular type of rain that he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type 17.\
\
He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbor\'92s boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the huskies have pissed on.\
\
Rob McKenna had two hundred and thirty-one different types of rain entered in his little book, and he didn\'92t like any of them.\
\
He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying.\
\
Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (postdownpour squalling, cold), all the sea-storm types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab-drumming), 11 (breezy droplets), and now his least favorite of all, 17.\
\
Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windshield so hard that it didn\'92t make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off.\
\
He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on.\
\
In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off.\
\
Swish swish swish flop swish swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flap scrape.\
\
He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player until it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it until it stopped again, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore.\
\
It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside.\
\
A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing machine, and hitching.\
\
\'93Poor miserable sod,\'94 thought Rob McKenna to himself, realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, \'93must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you.\'94\
\
He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn, and hit a large sheet of water square on.\
\
\'93See what I mean?\'94 he thought to himself as he plowed swiftly through it; \'93you get some right bastards on the road.\'94\
\
Splattered in his rearview mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitchhiker, drenched by the roadside.\
\
For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night.\
\
At least it made up for finally having been overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles.\
\
And as he drove on, the rain clouds dragged down the sky after him for, though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a Rain God. All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him and to water him.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 3\
\
\
The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did exactly the same thing.\
\
The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onward till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind.\
\
After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds.\
\
A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that normally he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift, only he couldn\'92t this time because he wasn\'92t going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand. He concluded the signaling with a cheery thumbs-up sign as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet, and he would catch him next time around.\
\
The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as the Renault.\
\
A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey a \'93Hello\'94 or a \'93Sorry, we\'92re going the other way\'94 or a \'93Hey look, there\'92s someone in the rain, what a jerk\'94 was entirely unclear. A green strip across the top of the windshield indicated that whatever the message was, it came from Steve and Carola.\
\
The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying \'93And another thing \'85\'94 twenty minutes after admitting he\'92d lost the argument.\
\
The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound traveled rather well. The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the turning stood a signpost and this the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly.\
\
And another.\
\
The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed meaninglessly. A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes.\
\
Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward toward it, but at the last moment the Cortina spun its wheels in the wet and careened off up the road rather amusingly.\
\
The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected.\
\
As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went into the hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix-up the surgeon removed his leg in error and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis, and justice, in its way, was served.\
\
The figure trudged on.\
\
A Saab drew to a halt beside him.\
\
Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, \'93Have you come far?\'94\
\
The figure turned toward it. He stopped and grasped the handle of the door.\
\
The figure, the car, and its door handle were all on a planet called the Earth, a world whose entire entry in The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy was comprised of two words \'93Mostly harmless.\'94\
\
The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a far from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 4\
\
\
Whether it was because he was drunk, ill, or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the lower south side of Han Dold City because it wasn\'92t the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive. Any observers in the place would have been mean, hawklike observers, heavily armed, with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didn\'92t like.\
\
One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a missile crisis sort of hush.\
\
Even the evil-looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, which was a service it provided for free.\
\
All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on stalks.\
\
The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defense budget with an American Express card, which was not acceptable anywhere in the known Universe.\
\
\'93What are you worried about,\'94 he asked in a cheery kind of voice, \'93the expiration date? Haven\'92t you guys ever heard of Neo-Relativity out here? There\'92re whole new areas of physics which can take care of this sort of thing. Time dilation effects, temporal relastatics\'97\'94\
\
\'93We are not worried about the expiration date,\'94 said the man to whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city. His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr made by the opening of an ICBM silo. A hand like a side of meat tapped lightly on the bar top, lightly denting it.\
\
\'93Well, that\'92s good then,\'94 said Ford, packing his satchel and preparing to leave.\
\
The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving.\
\
Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn\'92t attached to anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home. It had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to medical science. Medical science had decided they didn\'92t like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the Old Pink Dog Bar.\
\
The new barman didn\'92t believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything kooky like that, he just knew a useful ally when he saw one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered. Ford Prefect sat still.\
\
\'93We are not worried about the expiration date,\'94 repeated the barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect\'92s full attention; \'93we are worried about the entire piece of plastic.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 said Ford. He seemed a little taken aback.\
\
\'93This,\'94 said the barman, holding out the card as if it were a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the Land Where Fish Are Eternally Blessed. \'93We don\'92t accept it.\'94\
\
Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn\'92t have any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb.\
\
\'93But you don\'92t understand,\'94 said Ford, his expression slowly ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity, \'93this is the American Express card. It is the finest way of settling bills known to man. Haven\'92t you read their junk mail?\'94\
\
The cheery quality of Ford\'92s voice was beginning to grate on the barman\'92s ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more somber passages of a war requiem.\
\
One of the bones in Ford\'92s shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way that suggested the hand had learned the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropractor. He hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily, the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over.\
\
The barman slid the card back across the bar at Ford.\
\
\'93We have never,\'94 he said with muted savagery, \'93heard of this thing.\'94\
\
This was hardly surprising.\
\
Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error toward the end of the fifteen-year sojourn he had spent on the planet Earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express Company had gotten to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic-stricken demands of its debt collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the Vogons, to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.\
\
He had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept.\
\
\'93Credit?\'94 he said. \'93Aaaargggh \'85\'94\
\
These two words were usually coupled in the Old Pink Dog Bar.\
\
\'93I thought,\'94 gasped Ford, \'93that this was meant to be a class establishment.\'85\'94\
\
He glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps, and record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar\'92s inner recesses were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his, carefully picking up the threads of their former conversations about murders, drug rings, and music publishing deals. They knew what would happen now and didn\'92t want to watch in case it put them off their drinks.\
\
\'93You gonna die, boy,\'94 murmured the barman quietly at Ford Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have hanging up one of those signs that read \'93Please don\'92t ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends,\'94 but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to \'93Please don\'92t ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends.\'94 However, this made an unreadable mess of the notice and anyway didn\'92t have the same ring to it, so it was taken down again. It was felt that the story would get about of its own accord, and it had.\
\
\'93Lemme look at the bill again,\'94 said Ford. He picked it up and studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons.\
\
It was a rather lengthy piece of paper.\
\
At the bottom of it was a number that looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always take so long to copy on to the registration form. He had, after all, been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps, thugs, and record executives who suddenly couldn\'92t remember who he was.\
\
He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets. There was, as he knew, nothing in them.\
\
He rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the half-opened flap of his satchel. The disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder.\
\
\'93You see,\'94 said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of Ford\'92s, \'93I have a reputation to think of. You see that, don\'92t you?\'94\
\
This is it, thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill, it had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 he said quietly, \'93if it\'92s your reputation \'85\'94\
\
With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar top his copy of The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing.\
\
\'93Want a write-up?\'94\
\
The barman\'92s face stopped in midwobble. The bird\'92s talons stopped in midfurrow. The hand slowly released its grip.\
\
\'93That,\'94 said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between dry lips, \'93will do nicely, sir.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 5\
\
\
The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ. Indeed, its influence is so prodigious that strict rules had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So none of its field researchers is allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts, or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favors unless:\
\
a. they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way;\
\
b. their lives would be otherwise in danger; or\
\
c. they really want to.\
\
Since invoking the third rule involved giving the editor a cut, Ford always preferred to muck about with the first two.\
\
He stepped out along the street, walking briskly.\
\
The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music, and the distant sound of warring police tribes.\
\
He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the moment wasn\'92t much.\
\
A limousine careened down the street, dodging between the piles of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small Italian restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed.\
\
Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to the spaceport, but he had thought that before. He knew he was going through that part of the city where people\'92s plans often changed quite abruptly.\
\
\'93Do you want to have a good time?\'94 said a voice from a doorway.\
\
\'93As far as I can tell,\'94 said Ford, \'93I\'92m having one. Thanks.\'94\
\
\'93Are you rich?\'94 said another.\
\
This made Ford laugh.\
\
He turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture.\
\
\'93Do I look rich?\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Don\'92t know,\'94 said the girl. \'93Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you\'92ll get rich. I have a very special service for rich people.\'85\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 said Ford, intrigued but careful, \'93and what\'92s that?\'94\
\
\'93I tell them it\'92s okay to be rich.\'94\
\
Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players are two a penny in Han Dold City.\
\
Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway.\
\
\'93You what?\'94 he said.\
\
The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow. She was tall, and had that kind of self-possessed shyness which is a great trick if you can do it.\
\
\'93It\'92s my big number,\'94 she said. \'93I have a master\'92s degree in social economics and can be very convincing. People love it. Especially in this city.\'94\
\
\'93Goosnargh,\'94 said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian word he used when he knew he should say something but didn\'92t know what it should be.\
\
He sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that Ol\'92 Janx Spirit and a towel. He opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that the Ol\'92 Janx Spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of his towel.\
\
\'93Want some?\'94 he said, after he\'92d had a swig himself.\
\
She shrugged and took the proffered bottle.\
\
They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamor of burglar alarms in the next block.\
\
\'93As it happens, I\'92m owed a lot of money,\'94 said Ford, \'93so if I ever get hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?\'94\
\
\'93Sure, I\'92ll be here,\'94 said the girl. \'93So how much is a lot?\'94\
\
\'93Fifteen years\'92 back pay.\'94\
\
\'93For?\'94\
\
\'93Writing two words.\'94\
\
\'93Zarquon,\'94 said the girl, \'93which one took the time?\'94\
\
\'93The first one. Once I\'92d got that the second one just came one afternoon after lunch.\'94\
\
A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them.\
\
It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other. Cars with screaming sirens converged on the area, only to find themselves being picked off by helicopters which came thudding through the air between the city\'92s mountainous tower blocks.\
\
\'93In fact,\'94 said Ford, having to shout now above the din, \'93it wasn\'92t quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down.\'94\
\
He took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel.\
\
\'93Then the planet got demolished,\'94 he shouted, \'93really worthwhile job, eh? They\'92ve still got to pay me, though.\'94\
\
\'93You work for that thing?\'94 the girl yelled back.\
\
\'93Yeah.\'94\
\
\'93Good number.\'94\
\
\'93You want to see the stuff I wrote,\'94 he shouted, \'93before it gets erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net. Someone must have found out that the planet I spent fifteen years on has been demolished by now. They missed it on the last few revisions, but it can\'92t escape their notice forever.\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s getting impossible to talk, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
She shrugged and pointed upward.\
\
There was a helicopter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from the building. The sound engineer was hanging out the window by his fingertips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all of them.\
\
\'93Can we move?\'94\
\
They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran into a street theater group who tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the pack animal.\
\
All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide. They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted on a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen of the Guide.\
\
He located his entry.\
\
\'93Earth: Mostly harmless.\'94\
\
Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages.\
\
\'93Here it comes,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Please wait,\'94 said the messages. \'93Entries are being updated over the Sub-Etha Net. This entry is being revised. The system will be down for ten seconds. \'93\
\
At the end of the alley a steel-gray limousine crawled past.\
\
\'93Hey, look,\'94 said the girl, \'93if you get paid, look me up. I\'92m a working girl, and there are people over there who need me. I gotta go.\'94\
\
She brushed aside Ford\'92s half-articulated protests, and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swath of his working life being swept away electronically into the ether.\
\
Out in the street things had calmed down a little. The police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers, the street theater group was reemerging from the Italian restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect, and a little way farther on the steel-gray limousine was parked silently by the curb.\
\
She hurried toward it.\
\
Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was bathing Ford Prefect\'92s face, and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment.\
\
For where he had expected to find nothing\'97an erased, closed-off entry\'97there was instead a continuous stream of data\'97text, diagrams, figures, and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, yogurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars to go everywhere. Pages and pages of it. It was all there, everything he had written.\
\
With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backward and forward through it, stopping here and there at various entries.\
\
\
Tips for aliens in New York:\
\
Land anywhere, Central Park, anywhere. No one will care or indeed even notice.\
\
Surviving: get a job as a cabdriver immediately. A cabdriver\'92s job is to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines called taxis. Don\'92t worry if you don\'92t know how the machine works and you can\'92t speak the language, don\'92t understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae growing out of your head. Believe me, this is the best way of staying inconspicuous.\
\
If your body is really weird, try showing it to people in the streets for money.\
\
Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling, Noxios, or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East River, which is said to be richer in those lovely life-giving nutrients than the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved.\
\
Having fun: this is the big section. It is impossible to have more fun without electrocuting your pleasure center.\'85\'94\
\
\
Ford flipped the switch which he saw was marked \'93Mode Execute Ready\'94 instead of the now old-fashioned \'93Access Standby\'94 that had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone-aged \'93Off.\'94\
\
This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon ships. And then at last, five seconds after the moment he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, he felt the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and Arthur Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast.\
\
There was no mistake, there couldn\'92t have been. The Earth had definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away into space.\
\
And yet here\'97he activated the Guide again\'97was his own entry on how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered. He read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder.\
\
Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it was this, that something very weird was happening; and if something very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to be happening to him.\
\
He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street.\
\
Walking north again he passed a steel-gray limousine parked by the curb, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, \'93It\'92s okay, honey, it\'92s really okay, you got to learn to feel good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured.\'85\'94\
\
Ford grinned, detoured round the next block, which was now in flames, found a police helicopter that was standing unattended in the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers, and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky.\
\
He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, and once clear of them, hurtled through the black-and-red pall of smoke that hung permanently above it.\
\
Ten minutes later, with all the copter\'92s sirens blaring and its rapid-fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it careening down among the gantries and landing lights at Han Dold City spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled, and very noisy gnat.\
\
Since he hadn\'92t damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first-class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and he settled into one of its huge, voluptuous, body-hugging seats.\
\
This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing.\
\
\'93Yes, please,\'94 he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to offer him anything at all.\
\
He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously reinstated entry on the planet Earth. He had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to, and he was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve.\
\
It suddenly occurred to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and if he knew.\
\
\
Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty-seven light-years away in a Saab and anxious.\
\
Behind him in the back seat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he had climbed in. He didn\'92t know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with \'85 with \'85 This is absurd, he told himself. Calm down, he told himself. You are not, he continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster, in a fit and rational state. You have just hitchhiked over a hundred thousand light-years across the Galaxy, you are very tired, a little confused, and extremely vulnerable. Relax, don\'92t panic, concentrate on breathing deeply.\
\
He twisted round in his seat.\
\
\'93Are you sure she\'92s all right?\'94 he said again.\
\
Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heart-thumpingly beautiful, he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the exact shading of her hair. And he couldn\'92t ask her anything about herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious.\
\
\'93She\'92s just drugged,\'94 said her brother, shrugging, not moving his eyes from the road ahead.\
\
\'93And that\'92s all right, is it?\'94 said Arthur, in alarm.\
\
\'93Suits me,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Ah,\'94 said Arthur. \'93Er,\'94 he added after a moment\'92s thought.\
\
The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly.\
\
After an initial flurry of opening helios, he and Russell\'97the wonderful girl\'92s brother\'92s name was Russell, a name which to Arthur\'92s mind always suggested burly men with blond mustaches and blow-dried hair who would at the slightest provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirt fronts and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on billiards matches\'97had quickly discovered they didn\'92t like each other at all.\
\
Russell was a burly man. He had a blond mustache. His hair was fine and blow-dried. To be fair to him\'97though Arthur didn\'92t see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it\'97he, Arthur, was himself looking pretty grim. A man can\'92t cross a hundred thousand light-years, mostly in other people\'92s baggage compartments, without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot.\
\
\'93She\'92s not a junkie,\'94 said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be, \'93she\'92s under sedation.\'94\
\
\'93But that\'92s terrible,\'94 said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again. She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it.\
\
\'93What\'92s the matter with her, is she ill?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Russell, \'93merely barking mad.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 said Arthur, horrified.\
\
\'93Loopy, completely bananas. I\'92m taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog.\'94\
\
\'93A hedgehog?\'94\
\
Russell hooted his horn fiercely at a car that came round the corner toward them halfway across on to their side of the road, making them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better.\
\
\'93Well, maybe not a hedgehog,\'94 he said after he\'92d settled down again, \'93though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did. If somebody thinks they\'92re a hedgehog, presumably you just give \'92em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they feel better. At least medical science could deal with it, that\'92s the point. Seems that\'92s not good enough for Fenny, though.\'94\
\
\'93Fenny \'85?\'94\
\
\'93You know what I got her for Christmas?\'94\
\
\'93Well, no.\'94\
\
\'93Black\'92s Medical Dictionary.\'94\
\
\'93Nice present.\'94\
\
\'93I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order.\'94\
\
\'93You say her name is Fenny?\'94\
\
\'93Yeah. Take your pick, I said. Anything in here can be dealt with. The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have something different. Just to make life difficult. She was like that at school, you know.\'94\
\
\'93Was she?\'94\
\
\'93She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of.\'94\
\
\'93I can see how that would be irritating,\'94 said Arthur doubtfully. He was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was a rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldn\'92t sustain the name Fenella properly.\
\
\'93Not that I wasn\'92t sympathetic,\'94 continued Russell, \'93but it did get a bit irritating. She was limping for months.\'94\
\
He slowed down.\
\
\'93This is your exit, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93Ah no,\'94 said Arthur, \'93five miles farther on. If that\'92s all right.\'94\
\
\'93Okay,\'94 said Russell, after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn\'92t, and speeded up again.\
\
It was in fact Arthur\'92s exit, but he couldn\'92t leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up. He could take either of the next two exits.\
\
They led back to the village that had been his home, though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks had been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise in him to the shudders that only very very normal things can create, when seen where the mind is unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar light.\
\
By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it, living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight years since he had left, but what time had passed here he could hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home, should not be here.\
\
Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation, and breaking it no more than just a parking offense.\
\
\'93Delusions,\'94 said Russell.\
\
\'93What?\'94 said Arthur, startled out of his train of thought.\
\
\'93She says she suffers from strange delusions that she\'92s living in the real world. It\'92s no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says that\'92s why the delusions are so strange. Don\'92t know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting. Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer. I mean, you can only muck about so much, can\'92t you?\'94\
\
Arthur frowned, not for the first time. \'93Well \'85\'94\
\
\'93And all this dreams and nightmare stuff. And the doctors going on about strange jumps in her brain-wave patterns.\'94\
\
\'93Jumps?\'94\
\
\'93This,\'94 said Fenny.\
\
Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn\'92t in the car. Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping peacefully.\
\
\'93What did she say?\'94 he asked anxiously.\
\
\'93She said \'91this.\'92 \'94\
\
\'93This what?\'94\
\
\'93This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso\'92s tweezers. She\'92s barking mad, I thought I\'92d mentioned that.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t seem to care very much.\'94 Arthur tried to say it as matter-of-factly as possible but it didn\'92t seem to work.\
\
\'93Look, buster \'85\'94\
\
\'93Okay, I\'92m sorry. It\'92s none of my business. I didn\'92t mean it to sound like that,\'94 said Arthur. \'93I know you care a lot, obviously,\'94 he added, lying. \'93I know that you have to deal with it somehow. You\'92ll have to excuse me. I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula.\'94\
\
He stared furiously out the window.\
\
He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he thought had vanished into oblivion forever, the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said \'93this\'94 to him, and that he wouldn\'92t wish, her brother on a Vogon.\
\
\'93So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned,\'94 he went on to say as quickly as he could.\
\
\'93Look, this is my sister, I don\'92t even know why I\'92m talking to you about\'97\'94\
\
\'93Okay, I\'92m sorry. Perhaps you\'92d better let me out. This is \'85\'94\
\
At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them, through a sieve.\
\
Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked \'93McKenna\'92s All-Weather Haulage.\'94 The tension eased as the rain subsided.\
\
\'93It started out with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, you remember?\'94\
\
Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitchhiked back from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it would only confuse matters further.\
\
\'93No,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a caf\'e9 somewhere. Rickmansworth. Don\'92t know what she was doing there, but that was where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich.\'94\
\
Arthur winced.\
\
\'93I\'92m very sorry to hear that,\'94 he said a little stiffly.\
\
Russell made a sort of grumping noise.\
\
\'93So what,\'94 said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together, \'93was the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?\'94\
\
\'93Bobbing up and down, of course. He was dead.\'94\
\
\'93But what-\'94\
\
\'93Come on you remember all that stuff. The hallucinations. Everyone said it was the CIA experimenting with drug warfare or something. Some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think they\'92d been invaded.\'94\
\
\'93What hallucinations were those exactly \'85?\'94 said Arthur in a rather quiet voice.\
\
\'93What do you mean, what hallucinations? I\'92m talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we\'92re going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off. The CIA denied it, which meant it must be true.\'94\
\
Arthur\'92s head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something to steady himself, and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something, but nothing emerged.\
\
\'93Anyway,\'94 continued Russell, \'93whatever drug it was it didn\'92t seem to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana, so \'85 \'93\
\
He shrugged.\
\
\'93The Vogon \'85\'94 squeaked Arthur, \'93the yellow ships \'85 vanished?\'94\
\
\'93Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations,\'94 said Russell, and looked at Arthur oddly. \'93You trying to say you don\'92t remember any of this? Where have you been, for heaven\'92s sake?\'94\
\
This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he half leaped out of his seat with shock.\
\
\'93Christ!!!\'94 yelled Russell, fighting to control the car, which was suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up onto a grass bank. As the car lurched to a halt, the girl in the back was thrown against Russell\'92s seat and collapsed awkwardly.\
\
Arthur twisted round in horror.\
\
\'93Is she all right?\'94 he blurted out.\
\
Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow-dried hair. He tugged at his blond mustache. He turned to Arthur.\
\
\'93Would you please,\'94 he said, \'93let go of the handbrake?\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 6\
\
\
From here it was a four-mile walk to his village: a mile farther to the exit, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely declined to take him, and from there a farther three miles of winding country lane.\
\
The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat.\
\
He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up to the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk and maybe even some good painful blisters would help to reassure him of at least his own existence, if not his sanity.\
\
It was ten-thirty when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guinness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat.\
\
This was the pub in which he had passed the fatal lunchtime during which first his house and then the entire Earth had been demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished, no, damn it, had been demolished because if they hadn\'92t been then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and how had he got there if not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell had just been telling him were merely drug-induced hallucinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing on \'85?\
\
He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn\'92t going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he\'92d been over it.\
\
He started again.\
\
This was the pub in which he had passed the fatal lunchtime during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort out later had happened, and \'85\
\
It still didn\'92t make sense.\
\
He started again.\
\
This was the pub in which \'85\
\
This was a pub.\
\
Pubs served drinks and he could certainly do with one.\
\
Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with even if it wasn\'92t the one he had set out to achieve, he strode toward the door.\
\
And stopped.\
\
A small black wirehaired terrior ran out from behind a low wall and then, catching sight of Arthur clearly, began to snarl.\
\
Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an advertising friend of his, and was called Know-Nothing-Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog because the way its hair stood up on its head reminded people of the President of the United States of America, and the dog knew Arthur, or at least should. It was a stupid dog, but it should at least have been able to recognize Arthur instead of standing there, hackles raised, as if Arthur were the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble-witted life.\
\
This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself.\
\
Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he had to admit that the dog had a point.\
\
He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comment of a raucous kind, and worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard him with questions which at the moment he felt ill-equipped to deal with.\
\
Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know-Nothing-Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of Will\'92s own commercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had engine oil poured all over it.\
\
Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, there was his car, a gray Porsche 928S with a sign in the back window which read \'93My other car is also a Porsche.\'94 Damn him.\
\
He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadn\'92t known before.\
\
Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and underscrupulous bastards Arthur knew in advertising, made a point of changing his car every August so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on\'97and this was the same car Arthur remembered him having before. The number plate proclaimed its year.\
\
Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could have passed here.\
\
He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know-Nothing-Bozo jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now an alien on his own world. Try as they might, no one was even going to be able to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts.\
\
Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake?\
\
The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail\'97every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its unauthentic cast-iron light fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts. It was all the stuff of his home, his world.\
\
He even knew this blasted dog.\
\
\'93Hey, Know-Nothing!\'94\
\
The sound of Will Smithers\'92s voice meant he had to decide what to do quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment, and it was bitterly cold now.\
\
The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn\'92t that Arthur disliked him as such\'97Will was quite fun. It was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way because, being in advertising, he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where he had got his jacket from.\
\
Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van.\
\
\'93Hey, Know-Nothing, what\'92s up?\'94\
\
The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket that he\'92d got a mate of his at the Road Research Laboratory to crash a car into specially, in order to get that battered look. Know-Nothing yelped with delight and, having got the attention it wanted, was happy to forget Arthur.\
\
Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with the dog.\
\
\'93Commies!\'94 they all shouted at the dog in chorus, \'93Commies, Commies, Commies!!!\'94\
\
The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage. They all laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night.\
\
Well, that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind his van, this is quite definitely the planet I remember.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 7\
\
\
His house was still there.\
\
How or why, he had no idea, but he had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone, and there it was.\
\
He let himself in with a key he kept under a stone frog in the garden, hurriedly because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing.\
\
He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from.\
\
The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical, personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for nonpayment of bills on a credit card he didn\'92t have, thirty-three identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in today\'92s sophisticated jet-setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten.\
\
He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom, and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing.\
\
He collapsed, panting, onto his cold, musty-smelling bed and for a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to.\
\
When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to come on. To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur\'92s sense of logic. Since the Electricity Board had cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill, it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he hadn\'92t. Sending them money obviously only drew attention to himself.\
\
The room was much as he had left it, festeringly untidy, though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust. Half-read books and magazines nestled among piles of half-used towels. Half-pairs of socks reclined in half-drunk cups of coffee. What once had been a half-eaten sandwich had now half-turned into something that Arthur didn\'92t entirely want to know about. Bung a fork of lightning through this lot, he thought to himself, and you\'92d start the evolution of life off all over again.\
\
There was only one thing in the room that was different.\
\
For a moment or so he couldn\'92t see what the one thing that was different was, because it was too covered in a film of disgusting dust. Then his eyes caught it and stopped.\
\
It was next to a battered old television on which it was only possible to watch Open University study courses, because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down.\
\
It was a box.\
\
Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it.\
\
It was a gray box, with a kind of dull luster to it. It was a cubical gray box, just over a foot on one side. It was tied with a single gray ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top.\
\
He got up, walked over, and touched it in surprise. Whatever it was was clearly gift-wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him to open it.\
\
Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box.\
\
He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe, nestling in fine gray tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It wasn\'92t a proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur realized, turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl. A fishbowl.\
\
It was made of the most wonderful glass, perfectly transparent, yet with an extraordinary silver-gray quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making.\
\
Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the tissue paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing.\
\
He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful. It was exquisite. But it was a fishbowl.\
\
He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea dream.\
\
Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fishbowl\'92s surface. He held it up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass.\
\
\'93So Long,\'94 they said, \'93and Thanks \'85\'94\
\
And that was all. He blinked, and understood nothing.\
\
For fully five more minutes he turned the object around and around, held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing chime, and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap, and put it back on the table next to the television. He shook the little Babel fish from his ear and dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl. He wouldn\'92t be needing it anymore, except for watching foreign movies.\
\
He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light.\
\
He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes, and was completely incapable of getting to sleep.\
\
\
The night was uneasy with rain. The rain clouds themselves had now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small caf\'e9 just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didn\'92t know what else it might not do if further provoked.\
\
The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing machine, which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping list or a five-pound note.\
\
The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that\'92s trying to decide what sort of mood it\'92s in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight.\
\
A skylight creaked open.\
\
It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was slightly rotten and the hinge had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open.\
\
A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof.\
\
The figure stood and watched the sky in silence.\
\
The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild-looking creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecostructure and all.\
\
Instead, there was Arthur Dent, smooth and casual in corduroys and a bulky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed, his chin clean-shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it please to stop.\
\
They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience.\
\
The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the dark Earth around him a being in which he was rooted.\
\
He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rain clouds parked somewhere away to the south.\
\
He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadn\'92t expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but he\'92d never realized it could feel quite as good as that. He could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching at him all the way from the New Forest. He must try this summer, he thought, to see what having leaves felt like.\
\
From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered, for they were creatures who learned very little on their journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields.\
\
He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that. He could go further and further back, but it go dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things they\'92d been startled by the day before.\
\
He left the sheep and let his mind drift outward sleepily in developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly excited, one fractured.\
\
One fractured.\
\
He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in a memory course. He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is.\
\
He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to find her; but he could not. By straining too much for it, he could feel he was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander easily once more.\
\
And again, he felt the fracture.\
\
Again he couldn\'92t find it. This time, whatever his instincts were busy telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn\'92t certain that it was Fenny\'97or perhaps it was a different fracture this time. It had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all. It was different.\
\
He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling, seeping, sinking.\
\
He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always the fracture kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache.\
\
And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was time, the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had sensed, the second fracture, lay in the distance before him across the land, the thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of Earth.\
\
And suddenly he was upon it.\
\
He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, falling.\
\
Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths. He woke.\
\
A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead. The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His shoulders drooped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers. At last he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what it meant, if it meant anything at all, he would think about in the morning; for now he would go to bed and sleep. His own bed, his own sleep.\
\
He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was. It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rosebushes of one of his neighbors, John Ainsworth. His rosebushes were carefully tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes and labeled, and Arthur wondered what he was doing above them. He wondered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground.\
\
He picked himself up, brushed himself down, and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed.\
\
While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never, however, stood a chance of waking him up.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 8\
\
\
Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at all to discover it was the middle of February. He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes. Since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a virulent space disease he\'92d picked up without knowing it in the Flargathon Gas Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half, and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the Earth was lucky there.\
\
He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat.\
\
Just as he was finishing that, the phone rang, but he let it ring while he maintained a moment\'92s respectful silence. Whoever it was would ring back if it was important.\
\
He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside.\
\
There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk\'97some documents from the council, dated three years earlier, relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area; there was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity; and some postcards from friends vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days.\
\
He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which he marked \'93Things To Do.\'94 Since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning, he even added the word \'93Urgent!\'94\
\
He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega-Market. The slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua Centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a duty-free shop at a spaceport. The bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away.\
\
He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to Earth, kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A303. He had lost his battered and space-worn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed. He had lost The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy.\
\
Well, he told himself, this time I really won\'92t be needing it again.\
\
He had some calls to make.\
\
He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it out.\
\
He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department head.\
\
\'93Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven\'92t been in for six months but I\'92ve gone mad.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, not to worry. Thought it was probably something like that. Happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you?\'94\
\
\'93When do hedgehogs start hibernating?\'94\
\
\'93Sometime in spring, I think.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92ll be in shortly after that.\'94\
\
\'93Righty-ho.\'94\
\
He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of numbers to try.\
\
\'93Oh, hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to see if I could have a word with Fenella, er \'85 Fenella \'85 good Lord, silly me, I\'92ll forget my own name next, er, Fenella\'97isn\'92t this ridiculous? Patient of yours, dark-haired girl, came in last night \'85\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m afraid we don\'92t have any patients called Fenella.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, don\'92t you? I meant Fiona, of course, we just call her Fen\'97\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m sorry, goodbye.\'94\
\
Click.\
\
Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little.\
\
He had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night.\
\
\'93Arthur!!!!\'94\
\
He grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he\'92d had in Southern California.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 9\
\
\
He accepted another pint and took a pull at it.\
\
\'93Of course, I had my own personal alchemist, too,\'94\
\
\'93You what?\'94\
\
He was getting silly and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the first effects it has is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive.\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 he insisted with a happy glazed smile, \'93it\'92s why I\'92ve lost so much weight.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 said his audience.\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 he said again, \'93the Californians have rediscovered alchemy, oh yes.\'94\
\
He smiled again.\
\
\'93Only,\'94 he said, \'93it\'92s in a much more useful form than that which in\'94\'97he paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his head\'97\'93in which the ancients used to practice it. Or at least,\'94 he added, \'93failed to practice it. They couldn\'92t get it to work, you know. Nostradamus and that lot. Couldn\'92t cut it.\'94\
\
\'93Nostradamus?\'94 said one of his audience.\
\
\'93I didn\'92t think he was an alchemist,\'94 said another.\
\
\'93I thought,\'94 said a third, \'93he was a seer.\'94\
\
\'93He became a seer,\'94 said Arthur to his audience, the component parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, \'93because he was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that.\'94\
\
He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it.\
\
\'93What has alchemy got to do,\'94 asked a bit of the audience, \'93with losing weight?\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m glad you asked that,\'94 said Arthur, \'93very glad. And I will now tell you what the connection is between\'94\'97he paused\'97\'93between those two things. The things you mentioned. I\'92ll tell you.\'94\
\
He paused and maneuvered his thoughts. It was like watching oil tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel.\
\
\'93They\'92ve discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold,\'94 he said, in a sudden blurt of coherence.\
\
\'93You\'92re kidding.\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 he said, \'93no,\'94 he corrected himself, \'93they have.\'94\
\
He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely.\
\
\'93Have you been to California?\'94 he demanded. \'93Do you know the sort of stuff they do there?\'94\
\
Three members of his audience said they had and that he was talking nonsense.\
\
\'93You haven\'92t seen anything,\'94 insisted Arthur. \'93Oh yes,\'94 he added, because someone was offering to buy another round.\
\
\'93The evidence,\'94 he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by more than a couple of inches, \'93is before your eyes. Fourteen hours in a trance,\'94 he said, \'93in a tank. In a trance. I was in a tank. I think,\'94 he added after a thoughtful pause, \'93I already said that.\'94\
\
He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed. He composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be something about the tank needing to be oriented along a line dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a base line drawn between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss.\
\
\'93Long time,\'94 he said instead, \'93in a tank. In a trance.\'94 He looked round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following attentively.\
\
He resumed.\
\
\'93Where was I?\'94 he said.\
\
\'93In a trance,\'94 said one.\
\
\'93In a tank,\'94 said another.\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 said Arthur, \'93thank you. And slowly,\'94 he said, pressing onward, \'93slowly, slowly slowly, all your excess body fat \'85 turns \'85 to\'94\'97he paused for effect\'97\'93subcoo \'85 subyoo \'85 subtoocay\'94\'97he paused for breath\'97\'93subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed. Getting out of the tank is hell. What did you say?\'94\
\
\'93I was just clearing my throat.\'94\
\
\'93I think you doubt me.\'94\
\
\'93I was clearing my throat.\'94\
\
\'93She was clearing her throat,\'94 confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble.\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 said Arthur, \'93all right. And you then split the proceeds\'94\'97he paused again for a math break\'97\'93fifty-fifty with the alchemist. Make a lot of money!\'94\
\
He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but be aware of an air of skepticism about their jumbled faces.\
\
He felt very affronted by this.\
\
\'93How else,\'94 he demanded, \'93could I afford to have my face dropped?\'94\
\
Friendly arms began to help him home. \'93Listen,\'94 he protested, as the cold February breeze brushed his face, \'93looking lived-in is all the rage in California at the moment. You\'92ve got to look as if you\'92ve seen the Galaxy. Life, I mean. You\'92ve got to look as if you\'92ve seen life. That\'92s what I got. A face drop. Give me eight years, I said. I hope being thirty doesn\'92t come back into fashion or I\'92ve wasted a lot of money.\'94\
\
He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to help him along the lane to his house.\
\
\'93Got in yesterday,\'94 he mumbled. \'93I\'92m very very very happy to be home. Or somewhere very like it \'85 \'93\
\
\'93Jet lag,\'94 muttered one of his friends, \'93long trip from California. Really mucks you up for a couple of days.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t think he\'92s been there at all,\'94 muttered another. \'93I wonder where he has been. And what\'92s happened to him.\'94\
\
\
After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey. He wondered how he was going to find Fenny.\
\
He sat and looked at the fishbowl. He tapped it again, and despite being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which was gulping its way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before.\
\
Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He wondered who, and for what.\
\

Chapter 10\
\
\
At the third stroke it will be one \'85 thirty-two \'85 and twenty seconds.\'94\
\
\'93Beep \'85 beep \'85 beep.\'94\
\
Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked laugh.\
\
He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub-Etha Net to the ship\'92s superb hi-fi system, and the odd, rather stilted singsong voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin.\
\
\'93At the third stroke it will be one \'85 thirty-two \'85 and thirty seconds.\'94\
\
\'93Beep \'85 beep \'85 beep.\'94\
\
He tweaked the volume up just a little, while keeping a careful eye on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship\'92s computer display. For the length of time he had in mind, the question of power consumption became significant. He didn\'92t want a murder on his conscience.\
\
\'93At the third stroke it will be one \'85 thirty-two \'85 and forty seconds.\'94\
\
\'93Beep \'85 beep \'85 beep.\'94\
\
He checked around the small ship. He walked down the short corridor.\
\
\'93At the third stroke \'85\'94\
\
He stuck his head into the small, functional, gleaming steel bathroom.\
\
\'93 \'85 it will be \'85 \'93\
\
It sounded fine in there.\
\
He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters.\
\
\'93 \'85 one \'85 thirty-two \'85\'94\
\
It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of the speakers. He took down the towel.\
\
\'93 \'85 and fifty seconds.\'94\
\
Fine.\
\
He checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasn\'92t at all satisfied with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He broke open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button. He didn\'92t know why he hadn\'92t thought of that before. A whooshing, rumbling noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a slight hiss could be heard again.\
\
It stopped.\
\
He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again onto the new empty cargo hold.\
\
\'93 \'85 one \'85 thirty-three \'85 and fifty seconds.\'94\
\
Very nice.\
\
\'93Beep \'85 beep \'85 beep.\'94\
\
He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard.\
\
\'93At the third stroke it will be one \'85 thirty-four \'85 precisely.\'94\
\
He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck.\
\
He double-checked the computer display above the freezer bed, dimmed the lights, and checked it again.\
\
\'93At the third stroke it will be \'85 \'93\
\
He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin.\
\
\'93 \'85 one \'85 thirty-four and twenty seconds.\'94\
\
The voice sounded as clear as if he were hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn\'92t, not by a long way.\
\
He gazed out into the inky night. The star he could see in the distance the size of a brilliant biscuit crumb was Zondostina, or as it was known on the world from which the rather stilted, singsong voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta.\
\
The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas planet Sesefras Magna, where the Xaxisian battleships docked, and just rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, Epun.\
\
\'93At the third stroke it will be \'85 \'93\
\
For twenty minutes he sat and merely watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship\'92s computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity.\
\
\'93One \'85 fifty-nine \'85\'94\
\
His original plan had been to close down all external signaling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he\'92d had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal\'92s origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, traveling at light-speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did.\
\
\'93Beep \'85 beep \'85 beep \'85\'94\
\
He sniggered.\
\
He didn\'92t like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now.\
\
\'93At the third stroke \'85\'94\
\
The ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit round a little-known and never-visited moon. Almost perfect.\
\
One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ship\'92s little Escape-O-Buggy, balancing actions, reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, and saw that it was good.\
\
Before he left, he turned out the lights.\
\
As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still.\
\
\'93At the third stroke, it will be two \'85 thirteen \'85 and fifty seconds.\'94\
\
He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he didn\'92t have room.\
\
\'93Beep \'85 beep \'85 beep.\'94\
\

\
Chapter 11\
\
\
April showers I hate especially.\'94\
\
However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed determined to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move to another table, but there didn\'92t seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely.\
\
\'93Bloody April showers. Hate, hate, hate.\'94\
\
Arthur stared, frowning, out the window. A light, sunny spray of rain hung over the motorway. Two months he\'92d been back now. Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy. People had such extraordinarily short memories, including him. Eight years of crazed wanderings round the Galaxy now seemed to him not so much like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped off television and now kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch.\
\
One effect that still lingered, though, was his joy at being back. Now that the Earth\'92s atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he thought wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest.\
\
\'93Well, I like them,\'94 he said suddenly, \'93and for all the obvious reasons. They\'92re light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you feel good.\'94\
\
The man snorted derisively.\
\
\'93That\'92s what they all say,\'94 he said, and glowered darkly from his corner seat.\
\
He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening, unprovoked remark had been, \'93I\'92m a lorry driver. I hate driving in the rain. Ironic, isn\'92t it? Bloody ironic.\'94\
\
If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not encouraging.\
\
But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred now. \'93They all say that about bloody April showers,\'94 he said, \'93so bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather.\'94\
\
He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say something extraordinary about the government.\
\
\'93What I want to know is this,\'94 he said, \'93if it\'92s going to be nice weather, why,\'94 he almost spat, \'93can\'92t it be nice without bloody raining?\'94\
\
Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold.\
\
\'93Well, there you go,\'94 he said, and instead got up himself. \'93\'92Bye.\'94\
\
He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back through the parking lot, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain in his face. There was even, he noticed, a faint rainbow glistening over the Devon hills. He enjoyed that, too.\
\
He climbed into his battered but adored old black VW Rabbit, squealed the tires, and headed out past the islands of gas pumps and along the slip road to the motorway.\
\
He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had closed finally and forever above his head.\
\
He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him.\
\
He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe.\
\
He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things.\
\
The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a small umbrella.\
\
His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over.\
\
\'93Fenny!\'94 he shouted.\
\
Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her instead with the car door as he leaned across and flung it open.\
\
It caught her hand and knocked away the umbrella from it, which then bowled wildly away across the road.\
\
\'93Shit!\'94 yelled Arthur as helpfully as he could, leaped out of his own door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKenna\'92s All-Weather Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny\'92s umbrella instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away.\
\
The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy longlegs, expiring sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little.\
\
He picked it up.\
\
\'93Er,\'94 he said. There didn\'92t seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her.\
\
\'93How did you know my name?\'94 she said.\
\
\'93Er, well,\'94 he said, \'93look, I\'92ll get you another one.\'94\
\
He looked at her and tailed off.\
\
She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost somber, like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden. She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at.\
\
But when she smiled, as she did now, suddenly, it was as if she had just arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face, and impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was very disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell.\
\
She grinned, tossed her bag into the back, and swiveled herself into the front seat.\
\
\'93Don\'92t worry about the umbrella,\'94 she said to him as she climbed in, \'93it was my brother\'92s and he can\'92t have liked it or he wouldn\'92t have given it to me.\'94 She laughed and pulled on her seat belt. \'93You\'92re not a friend of my brother\'92s, are you?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
Her voice was the only part of her which didn\'92t say \'93Good.\'94\
\
Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these functions was vital to his driving or they were in trouble.\
\
So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother\'92s car, the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the moment or, if it had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well-balanced people are supposed to be balancing on.\
\
\'93So \'85\'94 he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start.\
\
\'93He was supposed to pick me up\'97my brother\'97but phoned to say he couldn\'92t make it. I asked about buses but the man started to look at a calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch. So.\'94\
\
\'93So.\'94\
\
\'93So here I am. And what I would like to know, is how you know my name.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps we ought to first sort out,\'94 said Arthur, looking back over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, \'93where I\'92m taking you.\'94\
\
Very close, he hoped, or a long way. Close would mean she lived near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there.\
\
\'93I\'92d like to go to Taunton,\'94 she said, \'93please. If that\'92s all right. It\'92s not far. You can drop me at\'97\'94\
\
\'93You live in Taunton?\'94 he said, hoping that he\'92d managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully close to him. He could \'85\
\
\'93No, London,\'94 she said, \'93there\'92s a train in just under an hour.\'94\
\
It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away up the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering heard himself, with horror, saying, \'93Oh, I can take you to London. Let me take you to London.\'85\'94\
\
Bungling idiot. Why on earth had he said \'93let\'94 in that stupid way? He was behaving like a twelve-year-old.\
\
She looked at him severely.\
\
\'93Are you going to London?\'94 she asked.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he didn\'92t say.\
\
\'93And I\'92ve got to step on it,\'94 he failed to add, omitting to glance at his watch.\
\
\'93I wasn\'92t,\'94 he said, \'93but \'85\'94 Bungling idiot.\
\
\'93It\'92s very kind of you,\'94 she said, \'93but really no. I like to go by train.\'94 And suddenly she was gone. Or rather, that part of her which brought her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly out the window and hummed lightly to herself.\
\
He couldn\'92t believe it.\
\
Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he\'92d blown it.\
\
Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction of centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not behave like this.\
\
Taunton 5 miles, said the signpost.\
\
He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled.\
\
He was going to have to do something dramatic.\
\
\'93Fenny,\'94 he said.\
\
She glanced round sharply at him. \'93You still haven\'92t told me how\'97\'94\
\
\'93Listen,\'94 said Arthur, \'93I will tell you, though the story is rather strange. Very strange.\'94\
\
She was still looking at him, but said nothing.\
\
\'93Listen \'85\'94\
\
\'93You said that.\'94\
\
\'93Did I? Oh. There are things I must talk to you about, and things I must tell you \'85 a story I must tell you which would \'85\'94 He was thrashing about. He wanted something along the lines of \'93Thy knotted and combined locks to part,/ And each particular hair to stand on end,/Like quills upon the fretful porcupine\'94 but didn\'92t think he could carry it off and didn\'92t like the hedgehog reference.\
\
\'93 \'85 which would take more than five miles,\'94 he settled for in the end, rather lamely, he was afraid.\
\
\'93Well \'85\'94\
\
\'93Just supposing,\'94 he said, \'93just supposing\'94\'97he didn\'92t know what was coming next, so he thought he\'92d just sit back and listen\'97\'93that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me, and that, though you didn\'92t know it, I was very important to you, but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and I was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to someone I\'92ve only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time, what would you say \'85\'94 He paused, helplessly, and looked at her.\
\
\'93 \'85 I should do?\'94\
\
\'93Watch the road!\'94 she yelped.\
\
\'93Shit!\'94\
\
He narrowly avoided careening into the side of a hundred Italian washing machines in a German lorry.\
\
\'93I think,\'94 she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, \'93you should buy me a drink before my train goes.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 12\
\
\
There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of pallor to the pork pies.\
\
Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches. There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do.\
\
\'93Make \'92em dry\'94 is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness, \'93make \'92em rubbery. If you have to keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing \'92em once a week.\'94\
\
It is by eating sandwiches in pubs at Saturday lunchtime that the British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been. They\'92re not altogether clear what those sins are, and don\'92t want to know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about. But whatever sins there are are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat.\
\
If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef\'92s hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in Stepney.\
\
The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific.\
\
\'93There must be somewhere better,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93No time,\'94 said Fenny, glancing at her watch, \'93my train leaves in half an hour.\'94\
\
They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses, and some soggy beer mats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got Fenny a tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it. And a couple of sausages, he didn\'92t know why. He bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass.\
\
The barman dunked Arthur\'92s change in a pool of beer on the bar, for which Arthur thanked him.\
\
\'93All right,\'94 said Fenny, glancing at her watch, \'93tell me what it is you have to tell me.\'94\
\
She sounded, as well she might, extremely skeptical, and Arthur\'92s heart sank. Hardly, he felt, the most conducive setting to try to explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a sort of out-of-body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the Earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, something which he alone on Earth knew anything about, having virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed deeply to go to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible.\
\
\'93Fenny,\'94 he started.\
\
\'93I wonder if you\'92d like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It\'92s just a little one.\'94\
\
He glanced up sharply.\
\
\'93To raise money for Anjie, who\'92s retiring.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93And needs a kidney machine.\'94\
\
He was being leaned over by a rather stiffly slim, middle-aged woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot.\
\
She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin.\
\
\'93Only ten pence each,\'94 she said, \'93so you could probably even buy two. Without breaking the bank!\'94 She gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously long sigh. Saying \'93without breaking the bank\'94 had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some G.I.s had been billeted on her in the war.\
\
\'93Er, yes, all right,\'94 said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins.\
\
With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was such a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur.\
\
\'93I do hope you win,\'94 she said with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami, \'93the prizes are so nice.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, thank you,\'94 said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch.\
\
He turned toward Fenny.\
\
So did the woman with the raffle tickets.\
\
\'93And what about you, young lady?\'94 she said. \'93It\'92s for Anjie\'92s kidney machine. She\'92s retiring, you see. Yes?\'94 She hoisted the little smile even farther up her face. She would have to stop and let it go soon or the skin would surely split.\
\
\'93Er, look, here you are,\'94 said Arthur, and pushed a fifty-pence piece at her in the hope that that would see her off.\
\
\'93Oh, we are in the money, aren\'92t we?\'94 said the woman, with a long smiling sigh. \'93Down from London, are we?\'94\
\
Arthur wished she wouldn\'92t talk so slowly.\
\
\'93No, that\'92s all right, really,\'94 he said with a wave of his hand, as she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by one.\
\
\'93Oh, but you must have your tickets,\'94 insisted the woman, \'93or you won\'92t be able to claim your prize. They\'92re very nice prizes, you know. Very suitable.\'94\
\
Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he could.\
\
The woman turned to Fenny once again.\
\
\'93And now, what about\'97\'94\
\
\'93No!\'94 Arthur nearly yelled. \'93These are for her,\'94 he explained, brandishing the five new tickets.\
\
\'93Oh, I see! How nice!\'94\
\
She smiled sickeningly at both of them.\
\
\'93Well, I do hope you-\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 snapped Arthur, \'93thank you.\'94\
\
The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter.\
\
He sighed and smiled.\
\
\'93Where were we?\'94\
\
\'93You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to.\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94\
\
She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice.\
\
\'93It\'92s why I asked if you were a friend of my brother\'92s. Or half-brother really. He\'92s the only one who calls me Fenny, and I\'92m not fond of him for it.\'94\
\
\'93So, what\'92s \'85?\'94\
\
\'93Fenchurch.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Fenchurch.\'94\
\
\'93Fenchurch.\'94\
\
She looked at him sternly.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 she said, \'93and I\'92m watching you like a lynx to see if you\'92re going to ask the same silly question that everyone asks me till I want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if you do. Plus I shall scream. So watch it.\'94\
\
She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered at him from behind it.\
\
\'93Oh,\'94 he said, \'93that\'92s a little unfair, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Fine.\'94\
\
\'93All right,\'94 she said with a laugh, \'93you can ask me. Might as well get it over with. Better than having you call me Fenny all the time.\'94\
\
\'93Presumably \'85\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93We\'92ve only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so generous when I spoke to you before\'97\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 snapped Arthur.\
\
The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets was waving the two last ones under his nose.\
\
\'93I thought I\'92d give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so nice.\'94\
\
She wrinkled up her nose a little confidentially.\
\
\'93Very tasteful. I know you\'92ll like them. And it is for Anjie\'92s retirement present, you see. We want to give her\'97\'94\
\
\'93A kidney machine, yes,\'94 said Arthur, \'93here.\'94\
\
He held out two more ten-pence pieces to her, and took the tickets.\
\
A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly. You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach.\
\
\'93Oh dear,\'94 she said, \'93I\'92m not interrupting anything, am I?\'94\
\
She peered anxiously at both of them.\
\
\'93No, it\'92s fine,\'94 said Arthur, \'93everything that could possibly be fine,\'94 he insisted, \'93is fine.\
\
\'93Thank you,\'94 he added.\
\
\'93I say,\'94 she said, in a delighted ecstasy of worry, \'93you\'92re not \'85 in love, are you?\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s very hard to say,\'94 said Arthur. \'93We haven\'92t had a chance to talk yet.\'94\
\
He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning.\
\
The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality.\
\
\'93I\'92ll let you see the prizes in a minute,\'94 she said, and left.\
\
Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with.\
\
\'93You were about to ask me,\'94 she said, \'93a question.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93We can do it together if you like,\'94 said Fenchurch. \'93Was I found \'85\'94\
\
\'93 \'85 in a handbag,\'94 joined in Arthur.\
\
\'93 \'85 in the Left Luggage office,\'94 they said together.\
\
\'93 \'85 at Fenchurch Street Station,\'94 they finished.\
\
\'93And the answer,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93is no.\'94\
\
\'93Fine,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93I was conceived there.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93I was con\'97\'94\
\
\'93In the Left Luggage office?\'94 hooted Arthur.\
\
\'93No, of course not. Don\'92t be silly. What would my parents be doing in the Left Luggage office?\'94 she said, rather taken aback by the suggestion.\
\
\'93Well, I don\'92t know,\'94 sputtered Arthur, \'93or rather\'97\'94\
\
\'93It was in the ticket queue.\'94\
\
\'93The\'96\'94\
\
\'93The ticket queue. Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate. They only say you wouldn\'92t believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station.\'94\
\
She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch.\
\
Arthur continued to gurgle chirpily for a moment or two.\
\
\'93I\'92m going to have to go in a minute or two,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93and you haven\'92t begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest.\'94\
\
\'93Why don\'92t you let me drive you to London?\'94 said Arthur. \'93It\'92s Saturday, I\'92ve got nothing particular to do, I\'92d\'97\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93thank you, it\'92s sweet of you, but no. I need to be by myself for a couple of days.\'94 She smiled and shrugged.\
\
\'93But\'97\'94\
\
\'93You can tell me another time. I\'92ll give you my number.\'94\
\
Arthur\'92s heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him.\
\
\'93Now we can relax,\'94 she said with a slow smile which filled Arthur till he thought he would burst.\
\
\'93Fenchurch,\'94 he said, enjoying the name as he said it, \'93I\'97\'94\
\
\'93A box,\'94 said a trailing voice, \'93of cherry liqueurs, and also, and I know you\'92ll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe music\'97\'94\
\
\'93Yes, thank you, very nice,\'94 insisted Arthur.\
\
\'93I just thought I\'92d let you have a look at them,\'94 said the permed woman, \'93as you\'92re down from London \'85\'94\
\
She was holding them out proudly for Arthur to see. He could see that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music. That was what they were.\
\
\'93I\'92ll let you have your drink in peace now,\'94 she said, patting Arthur lightly on his seething shoulder, \'93but I knew you\'92d like to see.\'94\
\
Arthur reengaged his eyes with Fenchurch\'92s once again, and suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come and gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman.\
\
\'93Don\'92t worry,\'94 said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass, \'93we will talk again.\'94 She took a sip.\
\
\'93Perhaps,\'94 she added, \'93it wouldn\'92t have gone so well if it wasn\'92t for her.\'94 She gave a wry smile and dropped her hair forward over her face again.\
\
It was perfectly true.\
\
He had to admit it was perfectly true.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 13\
\
\
That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was eight o\'92clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or next week sometime.\
\
No. No games. He wanted her and didn\'92t care who knew it. He definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her, wanted to do more things than there were names for with her.\
\
He actually caught himself saying things like \'93Yippee,\'94 as he pranced ridiculously round the house. Her eyes, her hair, her voice, everything \'85\
\
He stopped.\
\
He would put on the record of bagpipe music. Then he would call her.\
\
Would he, perhaps, call her first?\
\
No. What he would do was this. He would put on the record of bagpipe music. He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of it. Then he would call her. That was the correct order. That was what he would do.\
\
He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he did so.\
\
He picked up the record. It failed to blow up. He slipped it out of its cover. He opened the record player, he turned on the amp. They both survived. He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus onto the disk.\
\
He sat and listened solemnly to \'93A Scottish Soldier.\'94\
\
He listened to \'93Amazing Grace.\'94\
\
He listened to something about some glen or other.\
\
He thought about his miraculous lunchtime.\
\
They had just been on the point of leaving when they were distracted by an awful outbreak of \'93yoo-hooing.\'94 The appallingly permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird with a broken wing. Everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some sort of response.\
\
They hadn\'92t listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie was going to be about the \'a34.30 everyone had helped to raise toward the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs, and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo-hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37.\
\
Arthur discovered that he had. He glanced angrily at his watch.\
\
Fenchurch gave him a push.\
\
\'93Go on,\'94 she said, \'93go and get it. Don\'92t be bad-tempered. Give them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went. I\'92ll want to hear the record. Go on.\'94\
\
She flicked his arm and left.\
\
The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little overeffusive. It was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music.\
\
Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on breaking into laughter.\

Ring-ring.\
\
Ring-ring.\
\
Ring-ring.\
\
\'93Hello, yes? Yes, that\'92s right. Yes. You\'92ll \'92ave to speak up, there\'92s an awful lot of noise in \'92ere. What?\
\
\'93No, I only do the bar in the evenings. It\'92s Yvonne who does lunch, and Jim he\'92s the landlord. No, I wasn\'92t on. What?\
\
\'93You\'92ll have to speak up.\
\
\'93What? No, don\'92t know nothing about no raffle. What?\
\
\'93No, don\'92t know nothing about it. \'92Old on, I\'92ll call Jim.\'94\
\
The barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the noisy bar.\
\
\'93\'92ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he\'92s won a raffle. He keeps on saying it\'92s ticket 37 and he\'92s won.\'94\
\
\'93No, there was a guy in the pub here won,\'94 shouted back the barman.\
\
\'93He says \'92ave we got the ticket.\'94\
\
\'93Well, how can he think he\'92s won if he hasn\'92t even got a ticket?\'94\
\
\'93Jim says \'92ow can you think you\'92ve won if you \'92aven\'92t even got the ticket. What?\'94\
\
She put her hand over the receiver again.\
\
\'93Jim, \'92e keeps effing at me. Says there\'92s a number on the ticket.\'94\
\
\'93\'92Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle ticket, wasn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93\'92e says \'92e means it\'92s a telephone number on the ticket.\'94\
\
\'93Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?\'94\

Chapter 15\
\
\
Eight hours west sat a man alone on a beach mourning an inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne.\
\
He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn\'92t happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of the sea, and the day was gone.\
\
The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that runs west from Los Angeles, which is described in the new edition of The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as \'93junky, wunky, lunky, stunky, and what\'92s that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo,\'94 and in another, written only hours later as \'93being like several thousand square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow.\'94\
\
The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a \'93good place to go. It\'92s very easy to believe that everyone you meet there also is a space traveler. Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying \'91hi.\'92 Until you\'92ve settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say \'91no\'92 to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some very strange things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of.\'94 The hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers, and sunsets are described in the Guide as \'93boffo. A good one.\'94\
\
And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being insane. But this was only, as he would tell people, because he was.\
\
One of the many many reasons why people thought him insane was the peculiarness of his house which, even in a land where most people\'92s houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite extreme in its peculiarness.\
\
His house was called The Outside of the Asylum.\
\
His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be called\'97and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to do this\'97Wonko the Sane.\
\
In his house were a number of strange things, including a gray glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it.\
\
We can talk of him much later on. This is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it.\
\
He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting for the end of the world\'97little realizing that it had already been and gone.\

Chapter 16\
\
\
After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone number, Arthur tried everything he could to find Fenchurch, and the more things he tried, the more weeks passed.\
\
He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where he\'92d been just before he met her.\
\
\'93It\'92s the drizzle that makes me particularly morose.\'94\
\
\'93Please shut up about the drizzle,\'94 snapped Arthur.\
\
\'93I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling.\'94\
\
\'93Look\'97\'94\
\
\'93But I\'92ll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Blatter.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93It will blatter.\'94\
\
Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he had been driven there by superstition rather than logic. However, as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time.\
\
The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being dragged back into the whirlpool of the man\'92s exasperating conversation.\
\
\'93I think,\'94 said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to say this, \'93that it\'92s easing off.\'94\
\
\'93Ha!\'94\
\
Arthur just shrugged. He should go. That\'92s what he should do. He should just go.\
\
\'93It never stops raining!\'94 ranted the lorry driver. He thumped the table, spilled his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be steaming.\
\
You can\'92t just walk around without responding to a remark like that.\
\
\'93Of course it stops raining,\'94 said Arthur. It was hardly an elegant refutation, but it had to be said.\
\
\'93It rains \'85 all \'85 the time,\'94 raved the man, thumping the table again, in time to the words.\
\
Arthur shook his head.\
\
\'93Stupid to say it rains all the time,\'94 he said.\
\
The man\'92s eyebrows shot up, affronted.\
\
\'93Stupid? Why\'92s it stupid? Why\'92s it stupid to say it rains all the time if it rains all the whole time?\'94\
\
\'93Didn\'92t rain yesterday.\'94\
\
\'93Did in Darlington.\'94\
\
Arthur paused, warily.\
\
\'93You going to ask me where I was then yesterday,\'94 asked the man, \'93eh?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93But I expect you can guess.\'94\
\
\'93Do you.\'94\
\
\'93Begins with a D.\'94\
\
\'93Does it.\'94\
\
\'93And it was pissing down there, I can tell you.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t want to sit there, mate,\'94 said a passing stranger in overalls cheerily to Arthur, \'93that\'92s Thundercloud Corner, that is. Reserved special for old Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head here. There\'92s one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny Denmark. Steer clear is my advice. \'92Swhat we all do. How\'92s it going, Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet-weather tires on? Har-har.\'94\
\
He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to someone at a nearby table who roared with laughter.\
\
\'93See, none of them bastards take me seriously,\'94 said Rob McKenna, \'93but,\'94 he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, \'93they all know it\'92s true!\'94\
\
Arthur frowned.\
\
\'93Like my wife,\'94 hissed the sole owner and driver of McKenna\'92s All-Weather Haulage; \'93she says it\'92s nonsense and I make a fuss and complain about nothing, but\'94\'97he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes\'97\'93she always brings the washing in when I phone to say I\'92m on me way home!\'94 He brandished his coffee spoon. \'93What do you make of that?\'94\
\
\'93Well \'85\'94\
\
\'93I have a book,\'94 he went on, \'93I have a book. A diary. Kept it for fifteen years. Shows every single place I\'92ve ever been. Every day. And also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly,\'94 he snarled, \'93 \'92orrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales, I been. All round the Continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to Denmark, been to Yugoslavia. It\'92s all marked in and charted. Even when I went to visit my brother,\'94 he added, \'93in Seattle.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, \'93perhaps you\'92d better show it to someone.\'94\
\
\'93I will,\'94 said Rob McKenna.\
\
And he did.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 17\
\
\
Misery. Dejection. More misery and more dejection. He needed a project and he gave himself one.\
\
He would find where his cave had been.\
\
On prehistoric Earth he had lived in a cave, not a nice cave, a lousy cave, but \'85 There was no but. It had been a totally lousy cave and he had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years, which made it home of some kind, and a person likes to keep track of his homes. Arthur Dent was such a person and so he went to Exeter to buy a computer.\
\
That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer. But he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and blew a lot of bread on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was his serious purpose. To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric Earth. He explained this to the man in the shop.\
\
\'93Why?\'94 said the man in the shop.\
\
This was a tricky one.\
\
\'93Okay, skip that,\'94 said the man in the shop, \'93how?\'94\
\
\'93Well, I was hoping you could help me with that.\'94\
\
The man sighed and his shoulders dropped.\
\
\'93Have you much experience of computers?\'94\
\
Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard computer on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a second, or Deep Thought, or\'97but decided he wouldn\'92t.\
\
\'93No,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Looks like a fun afternoon,\'94 said the man in the shop, but he said it only to himself.\
\
Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous.\
\
Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn\'92t even know how long ago it had been, beyond Ford Prefect\'92s rough guess at the time that it was \'93a couple of million years\'94 and he simply didn\'92t have the math.\
\
Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations, and arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right galaxy; he just went ahead and got a result.\
\
He would call it the right result. Who would know?\
\
As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never know that. He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door.\
\
\'93Oh. I thought you were going to phone me first.\'94\
\
Arthur gaped in astonishment.\
\
\'93You can only come in for a few minutes,\'94 said Fenchurch. \'93I\'92m just going out.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 18\
\
\
A summer\'92s day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique-restoring machinery.\
\
Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur wandered in a blissed-out haze and looked at all the shops, which in Islington are quite a useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office furniture, or fish will readily confirm.\
\
The sun beat down over the roof gardens. It beat on architects and plumbers. It beat on barristers and burglars. It beat on pizzas. It beat on estate agent\'92s particulars.\
\
It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop.\
\
\'93It\'92s an interesting building,\'94 said the proprietor cheerfully. \'93There\'92s a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub. It was built for the Prince Regent apparently, so he could make his escape when he needed to.\'94\
\
\'93You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine furniture,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93No,\'94 said the proprietor, \'93not for that reason.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ll have to excuse me,\'94 said Arthur, \'93I\'92m terribly happy.\'94\
\
\'93I see.\'94\
\
He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of Greenpeace. He remembered the contents of his file marked \'93Things To Do\'97Urgent!\'94 which he hadn\'92t opened again in the meantime. He marched in with a cheery smile and said he\'92d come to give them some money to help free the dolphins.\
\
\'93Very funny,\'94 they told him, \'93go away.\'94\
\
This wasn\'92t quite the response he had expected, so he tried again. This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine.\
\
Just after six he returned to Fenchurch\'92s house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne.\
\
\'93Hold this,\'94 she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand, and disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar.\
\
The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington. As well as its large stable doors it also had a normal-looking front door of smartly glazed paneled wood with a black dolphin door knocker. The one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been used originally to haul up hay for hungry horses.\
\
An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The other end of the rope held a suspended cello.\
\
The door opened above his head.\
\
\'93Okay,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93pull on the rope, steady the cello. Pass it up to me.\'94\
\
He pulled on the rope, he steadied the cello.\
\
\'93I can\'92t pull on the rope again,\'94 he said, \'93without letting go of the cello.\'94\
\
Fenchurch leaned down.\
\
\'93I\'92m steadying the cello,\'94 she said, \'93you pull on the rope.\'94\
\
The cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and Fenchurch maneuvered it inside.\
\
\'93Come on up yourself,\'94 she called down.\
\
Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable doors, tingling.\
\
The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty rough and full of junk. A large cast-iron clothes wringer stood there, a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner. There was also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a baby carriage, but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books.\
\
The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked. And this was the measure of Arthur\'92s mood as he started up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing.\
\
\'93An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place,\'94 said Fenchurch chattily as Arthur emerged through the floor. \'93He keeps on coming round, standing in stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events and marvelous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have therefore so far failed to happen to it.\'94\
\
In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated, furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up Stonehenge.\
\
There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were interesting.\
\
There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could actually swing a cat in, \'93But,\'94 she added, \'93only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didn\'92t mind a few nasty cracks about the head. So. Here you are.\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
They looked at each other for a moment.\
\
The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from.\
\
For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if left alone for long enough with a Swiss cheese plant, the moment was one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo-born animal who wakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savanna stretching gray and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking.\
\
He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise.\
\
He hadn\'92t realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones until it now said something it had never said to him before, which was \'93yes.\'94\
\
Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her head.\
\
\'93I know,\'94 she said. \'93I shall have to remember,\'94 she added, \'93that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it.\'94\
\
She turned away.\
\
\'93Let\'92s go for a walk,\'94 she said quickly. \'93Hyde Park. I\'92ll change into something less suitable.\'94\
\
She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly shapely one, and it didn\'92t really suit her.\
\
\'93I wear it specially for my cello teacher,\'94 she said. \'93He\'92s a nice old boy, but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited. I\'92ll be down in a moment.\'94\
\
She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, \'93Put the bottle in the fridge for later.\'94\
\
He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it had an identical twin to sit next to.\
\
He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of her dress fall to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort of person he was. He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the blasted things if he had to. He would keep his head down.\
\
This he completely, utterly, and abjectly failed to do.\
\
She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she shook her head, dropped the light sundress down over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom.\
\
She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sun hat, and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed it and put her head slightly on one side.\
\
\'93Like it?\'94 she said.\
\
\'93You look gorgeous,\'94 he said simply, because she did.\
\
\'93Hmmm,\'94 she said, as if he hadn\'92t really answered her question.\
\
She closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur\'92s eyes followed hers around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying.\
\
Arthur looked back at her.\
\
\'93Ready?\'94\
\
\'93Did you know,\'94 she said with a slightly puzzled smile, \'93that there\'92s something wrong with me?\'94\
\
Her directness caught Arthur unprepared.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 he said, \'93I\'92d heard some vague sort of\'97\'94\
\
\'93I wonder how much you do know about me,\'94 she said. \'93If you heard from where I think you heard then that\'92s not it. Russell just sort of makes stuff up, because he can\'92t deal with what it really is.\'94\
\
A pang of worry went through Arthur.\
\
\'93Then what is it,\'94 he said, \'93can you tell me?\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t worry,\'94 she said, \'93it\'92s nothing bad at all. Just unusual. Very very unusual.\'94\
\
She touched his hand, and then leaned forward and kissed him briefly.\
\
\'93I shall be very interested to know,\'94 she said, \'93if you manage to work out what it is this evening.\'94\
\
Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his gray fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 19\
\
\
Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually awakened by the sound of gunfire.\
\
He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier machinery in its vicinity and padding it with towels. He slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. They were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises.\
\
That wasn\'92t it, though.\
\
He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew down the dim corridor past him, with a nasty searing screech.\
\
That wasn\'92t it either.\
\
He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor, though still ill-lit.\
\
The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was heavier. A small platoon of robots went by making a terrible clattering.\
\
Still not it, though.\
\
Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he walked along it in the other direction.\
\
He passed a series of observation monitors built into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched Plexiglas.\
\
One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system. It was hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly felt very strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down.\
\
That wasn\'92t it, though.\
\
He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it. There was nasty blaring music with it, too.\
\
That wasn\'92t it.\
\
He came upon another, much larger three-dimensional screen that was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship.\
\
As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot star cruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, silhouetted against the blinding disk of the star Xaxis, and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them.\
\
That was it.\
\
Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been burning earlier on but had now cooled down enough to sit on.\
\
He yawned and dug his copy of The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy out of his satchel. He activated the screen, and flickered idly through some level-three entries and some level-four entries. He was looking for some good insomnia cures. He found REST, which was what he reckoned he needed. He found REST AND RECUPERATION and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea. He looked up at the monitor screen. The battle was raging more fiercely every second and the noise was appalling. The ship juddered, screamed, and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received.\
\
He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his satchel again.\
\
He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the Guide.\
\
When all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, and went in search of the ship\'92s computer data banks.\
\

Chapter 20\
\
\
The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the summer, especially in parks,\'94 said the voice earnestly, \'93is to make girls\'92 breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am convinced that this is the case.\'94 Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment.\
\
\'93And I am certain,\'94 said the frizzy ginger-haired youth with the long thin nose who was expostulating from his deck chair by the side of the Serpentine, \'93that if one worked the argument through, one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from everything,\'94 he insisted to his thin dark-haired companion who was slumped in the next-door deck chair feeling dejected about his spots, \'93that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This is indisputable. And,\'94 he added, \'93I love it.\'94\
\
He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at Fenchurch. Arthur steered her away.\
\
\'93Next guess,\'94 she said, when she had stopped giggling, \'93come on.\'94\
\
\'93All right,\'94 he said, \'93your elbow. Your left elbow. There\'92s something wrong with your left elbow.\'94\
\
\'93Wrong again,\'94 she said, \'93completely wrong. You\'92re on completely the wrong track.\'94\
\
The summer sun was sinking through the trees in the park, looking as if\'97let\'92s not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings. Even the ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a summer\'92s evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through in an ambulance with the sheet pulled up over his face.\
\
It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere. Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts practicing the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused to chase off an American couple who had tried, timidly, to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in.\
\
\'93No!\'94 he shouted at them; \'93go away! I\'92m only practicing.\'94\
\
He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood.\
\
Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downward.\
\
\'93I don\'92t think it can be your bottom,\'94 he said after a while. \'93There doesn\'92t seem to be anything wrong with that at all.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 she agreed, \'93there\'92s absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom.\'94\
\
They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practiced on the other side of the tree.\
\
\'93I\'92ll tell you a story,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93Good.\'94\
\
They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks.\
\
\'93A story,\'94 said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her.\
\
\'93Which will tell something of the sort of things that happen to me. It\'92s absolutely true.\'94\
\
\'93True story.\'94\
\
\'93You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wife\'92s cousin\'92s best friend, but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line.\
\
\'93Well, it\'92s like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually happened to was me.\'94\
\
\'93Like the raffle ticket.\'94\
\
Arthur laughed. \'93Yes. I had a train to catch. I arrived at the station\'97\'94\
\
\'93Did I ever tell you,\'94 interrupted Fenchurch, \'93what happened to my parents in a station?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Arthur, \'93you did.\'94\
\
\'93Just checking.\'94\
\
Arthur glanced at his watch. \'93I suppose we could think of getting back,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Tell me the story,\'94 said Fenchurch firmly. \'93You arrived at the station.\'94\
\
\'93I was about twenty minutes early. I\'92d got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,\'94 he added after a moment\'92s reflection, \'93that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn\'92t occurred to me before.\'94\
\
\'93Get on with it.\'94 Fenchurch laughed.\
\
\'93So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.\'94\
\
\'93You do the crossword?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Which one?\'94\
\
\'93The Guardian usually.\'94\
\
\'93I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times. Did you solve it?\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93The crossword in The Guardian.\'94\
\
\'93I haven\'92t had a chance to look at it yet,\'94 said Arthur. \'93I\'92m still trying to buy the coffee.\'94\
\
\'93All right then. Buy the coffee.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m buying it. I am also,\'94 said Arthur, \'93buying some biscuits.\'94\
\
\'93What sort?\'94\
\
\'93Rich Tea.\'94\
\
\'93Good choice.\'94\
\
\'93I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don\'92t ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can\'92t remember. It was probably round.\'94\
\
\'93All right.\'94\
\
\'93So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.\'94\
\
\'93I see it perfectly.\'94\
\
\'93What you don\'92t see,\'94 said Arthur, \'93because I haven\'92t mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me.\'94\
\
\'93What\'92s he like?\'94\
\
\'93Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn\'92t look,\'94 said Arthur, \'93as if he was about to do anything weird.\'94\
\
\'93Ah. I know the type. What did he do?\'94\
\
\'93He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and \'85\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Ate it.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93He ate it.\'94\
\
Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. \'93What on earth did you do?\'94\
\
\'93Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,\'94 said Arthur, \'93to ignore it.\'94\
\
\'93What? Why?\'94\
\
\'93Well, it\'92s not the sort of thing you\'92re trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.\'94\
\
\'93Well, you could \'85 \'94 Fenchurch thought about it. \'93I must say I\'92m not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?\'94\
\
\'93I stared furiously at the crossword,\'94 said Arthur, \'93couldn\'92t do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,\'94 he added, \'93that the packet was already mysteriously open.\'85\'94\
\
\'93But you\'92re fighting back, taking a tough line.\'94\
\
\'93After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,\'94 said Arthur, \'93it stays eaten.\'94\
\
\'93So what did he do?\'94\
\
\'93Took another one. Honestly,\'94 insisted Arthur, \'93this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.\'94\
\
Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably.\
\
\'93And the problem was,\'94 said Arthur, \'93that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? \'92excuse me \'85 I couldn\'92t help noticing, er \'85\'92 Doesn\'92t work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.\'94\
\
\'93My man \'85\'94\
\
\'93Stared at the crossword again, still couldn\'92t budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin\'92s Day \'85\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93I went into the breach again. I took,\'94 said Arthur, \'93another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.\'94\
\
\'93Like this?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,\'94 said Arthur, \'93that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.\'94\
\
\'93I can imagine.\'94\
\
\'93We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me \'85 \'93\
\
\'93The whole packet?\'94\
\
\'93Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.\'94\
\
\'93Gladiators,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93would have had to do it in the sun. More physically grueling.\'94\
\
\'93There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course.\
\
\'93As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper\'85\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93Were my biscuits.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 said Fenchurch. \'93What?\'94\
\
\'93True.\'94\
\
\'93No!\'94 She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing.\
\
She sat up again.\
\
\'93You complete nitwit,\'94 she hooted, \'93you almost completely and utterly foolish person.\'94\
\
She pushed him backward, rolled over him, kissed him, and rolled off again. He was surprised at how light she was.\
\
\'93Now you tell me a story.\'94\
\
\'93I thought,\'94 she said, putting on a low husky voice, \'93that you were very keen to get back.\'94\
\
\'93No hurry,\'94 he said airily, \'93I want you to tell me a story.\'94\
\
She looked out over the lake and pondered.\
\
\'93All right,\'94 she said, \'93it\'92s only a short one. And not funny like yours, but \'85 anyway.\'94\
\
She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting. Arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business.\
\
\'93When I was a kid \'85\'94 she said. \'93These sorts of stories always start like this, don\'92t they? \'91When I was a kid \'85 \'92 Anyway. This is the bit when the girl suddenly says, \'91When I was a kid \'85 \'92 and starts to unburden herself. We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed.\'85 What do you think of it so far?\'94\
\
\'93I like it. I think it\'92s moving well. You\'92re getting the bedroom interest in nice and early. We could probably do with some development with the picture.\'94\
\
\'93It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like,\'94 she said, \'93but don\'92t. Full of endearing little animals doing endearing things, you know?\'94\
\
\'93I know. I was plagued with them too. Rabbits in waistcoats.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats and owls. There may even have been a reindeer.\'94\
\
\'93On the raft.\'94\
\
\'93On the raft. And a boy was sitting on the raft.\'94\
\
\'93Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer.\'94\
\
\'93Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety.\'94\
\
\'93Ugh.\'94\
\
\'93The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it who shouldn\'92t even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time. Worried me. Not badly, but just vaguely, all the time.\
\
\'93Then one day\'97and remember I\'92d been looking at this picture every night for years\'97I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail. Never seen it before. The otter was fine, he was just swimming along.\'94\
\
She shrugged.\
\
\'93Good story?\'94 she said.\
\
\'93Ends weakly,\'94 said Arthur, \'93leaves the audience crying, \'91Yes, but what of it?\'92 Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before the credits.\'94\
\
Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs.\
\
\'93It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and white becoming color, like a dry stick suddenly being watered. The sudden shift of perspective that says, \'91Put away your worries, the world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact very easy.\'92 You probably think I\'92m saying that because I\'92m going to say that I felt like that this afternoon or something, don\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93Well, I \'85\'94 said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered.\
\
\'93Well, it\'92s all right,\'94 she said, \'93I did. That\'92s exactly what I felt. But, you see, I\'92ve felt that before, even stronger. Incredibly strongly. I\'92m afraid I\'92m a bit of a one,\'94 she said, gazing off into the distance, \'93for sudden startling revelations.\'94\
\
Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser therefore for the moment not to try.\
\
\'93It was very odd,\'94 she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians might have said that the behavior of the Red Sea when Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side.\
\
\'93Very odd,\'94 she repeated, \'93for days before, the strangest feeling had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. No, it wasn\'92t like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected into something, bit by bit, no, not even that, it was as if the whole of the Earth, through me, was going to \'85\'94\
\
\'93Does the number,\'94 said Arthur gently, \'93forty-two mean anything to you at all?\'94\
\
\'93What? No, what are you talking about?\'94 exclaimed Fenchurch.\
\
\'93Just a thought,\'94 murmured Arthur.\
\
\'93Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious.\'94\
\
\'93I was being perfectly serious,\'94 said Arthur; \'93it\'92s just the Universe I\'92m never quite sure about.\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean by that?\'94\
\
\'93Tell me the rest of it,\'94 he said. \'93Don\'92t worry if it sounds odd. Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff,\'94 he added, \'93that is odd. And I don\'92t mean biscuits.\'94\
\
She nodded, and seemed to believe him. Suddenly, she gripped his arm.\
\
\'93It was so simple,\'94 she said, \'93so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple, when it came.\'94\
\
\'93What was it?\'94 said Arthur quietly.\
\
\'93Arthur, you see,\'94 she said, \'93that\'92s what I no longer know. And the loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it it all goes flickery and jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the teacup and I just black out.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Well, like your story,\'94 she said, \'93the best bit happened in a caf\'e9. I was sitting there, having a cup of tea. This was after days of this build-up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I think I was buzzing gently. And there was some work going on at a building site opposite the caf\'e9, and I was watching it through the window, over the rim of my teacup, which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people working. And suddenly, there it was in my mind, this message from somewhere. And it was so simple. It made such sense of everything. I just sat up and thought, \'91Oh! Oh, well, that\'92s all right, then.\'92 I was so startled I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it. Yes,\'94 she added thoughtfully, \'93I\'92m sure I did. How much sense am I making?\'94\
\
\'93It was fine up to the bit about the teacup.\'94\
\
She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it, which is what she was trying to do.\
\
\'93Well, that\'92s it,\'94 she said, \'93fine up to the bit about the teacup. That was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded.\'94\
\
\'93What \'85?\'94\
\
\'93I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 3D with 16-track Dolby stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with shark movies. It was as if the ground was literally ripped from under my feet, and \'85 and \'85\'94\
\
She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say.\
\
\'93And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I\'92ve been in and out ever since. And that\'92s why I have an instinctive nervousness,\'94 she said, \'93of sudden startling revelations that everything\'92s going to be all right.\'94 She looked up at him.\
\
Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked \'93Things To Think About\'97Urgent.\'94 \'93Here is the world,\'94 he had told himself, \'93here, for whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays. With me on it.\'94 But now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the car when Fenchurch\'92s brother had told him the silly story of the CIA agent in the reservoir. The French Embassy went swimmy. The Sheraton Tower Hotel and the Bank of Abu Dhabi went swimmy. The trees went swimmy. The lake went swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed at because a gray goose had just landed on it. The geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to.\
\
\'93Anyway,\'94 said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide-eyed smile, \'93there is something wrong with part of me, and you\'92ve got to find out what it is. We\'92ll go home.\'94\
\
Arthur shook his head.\
\
\'93What\'92s the matter?\'94 she said.\
\
Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world\'92s great suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him.\
\
\'93I\'92m just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind,\'94 said Arthur. \'93You say you felt as if the Earth actually \'85 exploded.\'85\'94\
\
\'93Yes. More than felt.\'94\
\
\'93Which is what everybody else says,\'94 he said hesitantly, \'93is hallucinations?\'94\
\
\'93Yes but, Arthur, that\'92s ridiculous. People think that if you just say \'91hallucinations\'92 it explains anything you want it to explain and eventually whatever it is you can\'92t understand will just go away. It\'92s just a word, it doesn\'92t explain anything. It doesn\'92t explain why the dolphins disappeared.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Arthur, \'93no,\'94 he added thoughtfully. \'93No,\'94 he added again, even more thoughtfully. \'93What?\'94 he said at last.\
\
\'93Doesn\'92t explain the dolphins disappearing.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Arthur, \'93I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean which dolphins? I\'92m talking about when all the dolphins disappeared.\'94\
\
She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back, and must instead be one of those nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him.\
\
\'93Disappeared?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93The dolphins?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93All the dolphins,\'94 said Arthur, \'93disappeared?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93The dolphins? You\'92re saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is this,\'94 said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, \'93what you\'92re saying?\'94\
\
\'93Arthur, where have you been, for heaven\'92s sake? The dolphins all disappeared on the same day I \'85 \'93\
\
She stared him intently in his startled eyes.\
\
\'93What \'85?\'94\
\
\'93No dolphins. All gone. Vanished.\'94\
\
She searched his face.\
\
\'93Did you really not know that?\'94\
\
It was clear from his startled expression that he did not.\
\
\'93Where did they go?\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93No one knows. That\'92s what vanished means.\'94 She paused. \'93Well, there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he lives in California,\'94 she said, \'93and is mad. I was thinking of going to see him because it seems the only lead I\'92ve got on what happened to me.\'94\
\
She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly. She laid her hand on the side of his face.\
\
\'93I really would like to know where you\'92ve been,\'94 she said. \'93I think something terrible happened to you then as well. And that\'92s why we recognized each other.\'94\
\
She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 she said, \'93now you\'92ve got someone you can tell.\'94\
\
Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh.\
\
\'93It is,\'94 he said, \'93a very long story.\'94\
\
Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag.\
\
\'93Is it anything to do with this?\'94 she said. The thing she took out of her bag was battered and travel-worn as if it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of Kakrafoon, half buried in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapored oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in large friendly letters, the words \'93Don\'92t Panic.\'94\
\
\'93Where did you get this?\'94 said Arthur, startled, taking it from her.\
\
\'93Ah,\'94 she said, \'93I thought it was yours. In Russell\'92s car that night. You dropped it. Have you been to many of these places?\'94\
\
Arthur drew The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy from its cover. It was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer. He tapped some buttons till the screen flared with text.\
\
\'93A few,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Can we go?\'94\
\
\'93What? No,\'94 said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented warily. \'93Do you want to?\'94 he said, hoping for the answer no. It was an act of great generosity on his part not to say, \'93You don\'92t want to, do you?\'94 which expects it.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 she said. \'93I want to know what the message was that I lost, and where it came from. Because I don\'92t think,\'94 she added, standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park, \'93that it came from here.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m not even sure,\'94 she further added, slipping her arm around Arthur\'92s waist, \'93that I know where here is.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 21\
\
\
The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing. It is, essentially, as the title implies, a guidebook. The problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizable number of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial, and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this.\
\
The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem.\
\
This is:\
\
Change.\
\
Read it through again and you\'92ll get it.\
\
The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so much of it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing. A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong. Where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all the editors the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the meaning of the words \'93scrupulous,\'94 \'93conscientious,\'94 and \'93diligent,\'94 and tends to get his nightmares through a straw.\
\
Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub-Etha Net according to if they read good.\
\
Take, for example, the case of Brequinda on the Foth of Avalars, famed in myth, legend, and stultifyingly dull tri-d miniseries as home of the magnificent and magical Fuolornis Fire Dragon.\
\
In ancient days, before the advent of the Sorth of Bragadox, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but they all somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone\'92s guess, virgins, it was not possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars without hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis Fire Dragons.\
\
Whether you would want to do that is another matter.\
\
Not that Fire Dragons weren\'92t an essentially peace-loving species, because they were. They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the one one loves, especially if one is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence. Another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well. Add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons.\
\
But did they mind? They did not.\
\
Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No.\
\
The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars for their savage beauty, their noble ways, and their habit of biting people who didn\'92t revere them.\
\
Why was this?\
\
The answer was simple.\
\
Sex.\
\
There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost unbearably sexy about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side.\
\
Why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk-winged leather-bodied Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon than half the people of Brequinda were scurrying off into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins.\
\
Pheromones, some researchers said.\
\
Something sonic, others claimed.\
\
The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it.\
\
Not surprisingly, the Guide\'92s graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular among hitchhikers who allow themselves to be guided by it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it is therefore left to latter-day travelers to find out for themselves that today\'92s modern Brequinda in the city-state of Avalars is now little more than concrete, strip joints, and Dragon Burger Bars.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 22\
\
\
The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant.\
\
There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the alley, but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed.\
\
Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their pizza with extra anchovies they could always have sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is now known to have much the same effect.\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93not yet.\'94\
\
Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions very close to the open bottle of champagne.\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93not till you\'92ve found out what\'92s wrong with me, which bit. But I suppose,\'94 she added, very, very, very quietly, \'93that we may as well start with where your hand is now.\'94\
\
Arthur said, \'93So which way do I go?\'94\
\
\'93Down,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93on this occasion.\'94\
\
He moved his hand.\
\
\'93Down,\'94 she said, \'93is in fact the other way.\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes.\'94\
\
Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff drink\'97which is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadn\'92t yet got to that bit, but there will be too much else going on when it does, and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now while things are still moving slowly.\
\
\'93And so we come,\'94 said Arthur, \'93to your knee. There is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee.\'94\
\
\'93My left knee,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93is absolutely fine.\'94\
\
\'93So it is.\'94\
\
\'93Did you know that \'85\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, it\'92s all right, I can tell you do. No, keep going.\'94\
\
\'93So it has to be something to do with your feet.\'85\'94\
\
She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in the Universe, on Sqornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being wriggled against, particularly if it\'92s noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move, it\'92s a pity they weren\'92t there. They weren\'92t, but such is life.\
\
Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully. All kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point.\
\
\'93I have to admit,\'94 he said, \'93that I really don\'92t know what I\'92m looking for.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ll know when you find it,\'94 she said, \'93really you will.\'94 There was a slight catch in her voice. \'93It\'92s not that one.\'94\
\
Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot. She moved forward, put her arms round him and kissed him, because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would know made it impossible not to do this.\
\
Then she gave him her right foot.\
\
He stroked it, ran his fingers around her ankle, under her toes, along her instep, could find nothing wrong with it.\
\
She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her head.\
\
\'93No, don\'92t stop,\'94 she said, \'93but it\'92s not that one now.\'94\
\
Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor.\
\
\'93Don\'92t stop.\'94\
\
He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under her toes, along her instep, and said, \'93You mean it\'92s something to do with which leg I\'92m holding \'85?\'94\
\
She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from Sqornshellous Beta.\
\
He frowned.\
\
\'93Pick me up,\'94 she said quietly.\
\
He let her right foot down on the floor and stood up. So did she. He picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on for a while, then she said, \'93Now put me down again.\'94\
\
Still puzzled, he did so.\
\
\'93Well?\'94\
\
She looked at him almost challengingly.\
\
\'93So what\'92s wrong with my feet?\'94 she said.\
\
Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it were, in their normal habitat. And as he looked closely, something odd struck him. He put his head right down to the ground and peered. There was a long pause. He sat back heavily.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he said, \'93I see what\'92s wrong with your feet. They don\'92t touch the ground.\'94\
\
\'93So \'85 so what do you think \'85?\'94\
\
Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling.\
\
\'93What do \'85 \'94 she stammered, \'93 \'85 are you \'85?\'94 She shook the hair forward over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears.\
\
He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single kiss.\
\
\'93Perhaps you can do what I can do,\'94 he said, and walked straight out of her upstairs front door.\
\
The record got to the good bit.\
\

\
Chapter 23\
\
\
The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis. Hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Xaxisian ship was able to deploy. Part of the moon had gone, too, blasted away by those same blazing force guns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it.\
\
The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle.\
\
All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the ship was gone.\
\
With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space, quickly, effortlessly, and above all, quietly.\
\
Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old haunts. He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York. In his dreams he was walking late at night along the East Side, beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new life forms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding welfare and voting rights.\
\
One of these floated past, waving. Ford waved back.\
\
The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank.\
\
\'93Hi,\'94 it said, \'93I\'92ve just been created. I\'92m completely new to the Universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?\'94\
\
\'93Phew,\'94 said Ford, a little nonplussed, \'93I can tell you where some bars are, I guess.\'94\
\
\'93What about love and happiness? I sense deep needs for things like that,\'94 it said, waving its tentacles. \'93Got any leads there?\'94\
\
\'93You can get some of that,\'94 said Ford, \'93on Seventh Avenue.\'94\
\
\'93I instinctively feel,\'94 said the creature, urgently, \'93that I need to be beautiful. Am I?\'94\
\
\'93You\'92re pretty direct, aren\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93No point in mucking about. Am I?\'94\
\
The thing was oozing all over the place now, squelching and blubbering. A nearby wino was getting interested.\
\
\'93To me?\'94 said Ford. \'93No. But listen,\'94 he added after a moment, \'93most people make out, you know. Are there any more like you down there?\'94\
\
\'93Search me, buster,\'94 said the creature. \'93As I said, I\'92m new here. Life is entirely strange to me. What\'92s it like?\'94\
\
Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with authority.\
\
\'93Life,\'94 he said, \'93is like a grapefruit.\'94\
\
\'93Er, how so?\'94\
\
\'93Well, it\'92s sort of orangy-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy in the middle. It\'92s got pips inside, too. Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast.\'94\
\
\'93Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?\'94\
\
\'93I expect so,\'94 said Ford; \'93ask a policeman.\'94\
\
Deep in his bunk, Ford Prefect wriggled and turned onto his other side. It wasn\'92t his favorite type of dream because it didn\'92t have Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six) in it, whom many of his dreams did feature. But at least it was a dream. At least he was asleep.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 24\
\
\
Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur hadn\'92t done this sort of thing for a while, at least not deliberately, and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it.\
\
He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with the doorstep, and tumbled through the air, so suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didn\'92t.\
\
A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it.\
\
The ground was hanging menacingly above his head.\
\
He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldn\'92t at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests, so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of general well-disposedness toward things, and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasn\'92t touching anything.\
\
A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway.\
\
After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the ground.\
\
\'93Arthur\'85\'94\
\
The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall away from it, which is what he did. Slowly. Very, very slowly.\
\
As he fell, slowly, very, very slowly, he closed his eyes\'97carefully, so as not to jolt anything.\
\
The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he slowly, very, very slowly revolved his body one way and his mind the other.\
\
That should sort the ground out.\
\
He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very, very slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes.\
\
He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until all the bird talk had driven him scatty, but this was different.\
\
Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things, being in the air.\
\
Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street.\
\
Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious time switch which meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in. He was therefore safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity.\
\
He slowly, very, very slowly lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her upstairs doorway.\
\
Her face was inches from his.\
\
\'93I was about to ask you,\'94 she said in a low, trembly voice, \'93what you were doing. But then I realized that I could see what you were doing. You were flying. So it seemed,\'94 she went on after a slight wondering pause, \'93like a bit of a silly question. And I couldn\'92t immediately think of any others.\'94\
\
Arthur said, \'93Can you do it?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Would you like to try?\'94\
\
She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just in sheer bewilderment. She was shaking like a leaf.\
\
\'93It\'92s quite easy,\'94 urged Arthur, \'93if you don\'92t know how. That\'92s the important bit. Be not at all sure how you\'92re doing it.\'94\
\
Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley, fell dramatically upward and bobbed back down toward her like a banknote on a breath of wind.\
\
\'93Ask me how I did that.\'94\
\
\'93How \'85 did you do that?\'94\
\
\'93No idea. Not a clue.\'94\
\
She shrugged in bewilderment. \'93So how can I \'85?\'94\
\
Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand.\
\
\'93I want you to try,\'94 he said, \'93to step onto my hand, just one foot.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Try it.\'94\
\
Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying to step onto the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in midair, she stepped onto his hand.\
\
\'93Now the other.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Take the weight off your back foot.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t.\'94\
\
\'93Try it.\'94\
\
\'93Like this?\'94\
\
\'93Like that.\'94\
\
Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if\'97she stopped telling herself what what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didn\'92t altogether want to know.\
\
She fixed her eyes very, very firmly on the gutter of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody and didn\'92t think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn\'92t standing on anything at all.\
\
\'93Now,\'94 said Arthur, \'93take your weight off your left foot.\'94\
\
She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company that had their offices around the corner and took her weight off her left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter.\
\
\'93Now,\'94 said Arthur, \'93take the weight off your right foot.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t.\'94\
\
\'93Try.\'94\
\
She had never seen the gutter from this angle before, and it looked to her now as if there might be a bird\'92s nest as well as all the mud and gunge up there. If she leaned forward just a little and took her weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly.\
\
Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn\'92t want to get involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up.\
\
He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys and habitually didn\'92t expect to find their owners hovering several feet above him. He was relaxed by both these habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably bound to an iron bar embedded in concrete by hoops of tungsten carbide, he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way.\
\
Arthur let out a long-held breath.\
\
\'93See what a piece of eggshell I have found you,\'94 said Fenchurch in his ear.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 25\
\
\
Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may have received an impression of his character and habits which, while it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the truth, falls somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects.\
\
And the reasons for this are obvious: editing, selection, the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance.\
\
Like this, for instance: \'93Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor. He put on his pajamas, the blue ones with the stripes. He washed his face and hands, brushed his teeth, went to the bathroom, realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again, and went to bed. He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night, then he turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep.\
\
\'93It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour.\
\
\'93After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back onto his left side. And so he whiled the night away, sleeping.\
\
\'93At four he got up and went to the bathroom again. He opened the door to the bathroom \'85\'94 and so on.\
\
It\'92s guff. It doesn\'92t advance the action. It makes for nice fat books such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn\'92t actually get you anywhere. You don\'92t, in short, want to know.\
\
But there are other omissions as well, besides the toothbrushing-and-trying-to-find-fresh-socks variety, and in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested.\
\
What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings with Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere?\
\
To which the answer was, of course, mind your own business.\
\
And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet Krikkit? Just because the planet didn\'92t have Fuolornis Fire Dragons or Dire Straits doesn\'92t mean that the whole planet just sat up every night reading.\
\
Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the committee meeting party on prehistoric Earth when Arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet Golgafrincham? What then? What happened next? And the answer is, of course, that the book ended.\
\
The next one didn\'92t resume the story till five years later, and you can, claim some, take discretion too far. \'93This Arthur Dent,\'94 comes the cry from the farthest reaches of the Galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep-space probe thought to originate from another alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate, \'93what is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?\'94\
\
Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 26\
\
\
Arthur Dent very much hoped, for an unworthy moment, as they drifted up, that his friends who had always found him pleasant but dull or, more latterly, odd but dull, were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last time, for a while, that he thought of them.\
\
They drifted up, spiraling slowly around each other, like sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the other way.\
\
And as they drifted up, their minds sang with the ecstatic knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do.\
\
Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out toward the Westway flyover, on keeping the street lights lit and on making sure that when somebody in Baker Street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground.\
\
Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of lights of London\'97London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the strangely colored fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the Galaxy, lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them, but London\'97swayed, swaying and turning, turned.\
\
\'93Try a swoop,\'94 he called to Fenchurch.\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty air. It was breathy and faint with disbelief\'97all those things, clear, faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time.\
\
\'93We\'92re flying \'85\'94 she said.\
\
\'93A trifle,\'94 called Arthur, \'93think nothing of it. Try a swoop.\'94\
\
\'93A sw\'97\'94\
\
Her hand caught his, and in a sudden second her weight caught it, too, and stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing wildly at nothing.\
\
Physics glanced at Arthur and, clotted with horror, he was gone, too, sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but his voice.\
\
They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn\'92t do this sort of thing here.\
\
He couldn\'92t catch her because this was London, and not a million miles from here\'97seven hundred and fifty-six, to be exact, in Pisa, where Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights.\
\
They fell.\
\
Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the Italians had to say about physics when they couldn\'92t even keep a simple tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and he damn well did fall faster than Fenchurch.\
\
He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her shoulders. He got it.\
\
Fine. They were now falling together, which was all very sweet and romantic, but didn\'92t solve the basic problem, which was that they were falling, and the ground wasn\'92t waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to meet them like an express train.\
\
He couldn\'92t support her weight, he hadn\'92t anything he could support it with or against. The only thing he could think was that they were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than the obvious. Here he felt he was on familiar territory.\
\
He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face to him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with his little finger and swung her back upward, tumbling clumsily up after her.\
\
\'93Shit,\'94 she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on up into the night.\
\
Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had impossibly come. The ground was something not to regard with any too firm or steady eye, but merely to glance at, as it were, in passing.\
\
Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she judged herself right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her, and this is where readers who are keen to know what Marvin and Ford Prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later chapters, because Arthur now could wait no longer and helped her take it off.\
\
It drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck which finally vanished, and for obvious complicated reasons revolutionized the life of a family in Hounslow, over whose washing line it was discovered draped in the morning.\
\
In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming among the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an airplane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy airplane and looking through the little scratchy Plexiglas window while somebody else\'92s son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt.\
\
Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin. They felt, even Fenchurch, now protected from the elements only by a couple of fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going to let the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle.\
\
The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch rose now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very, very slowly, which is the only way it\'92s possible to do it when you\'92re flying and also not using your hands, went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from top to bottom, Isleworth and Richmond.\
\
They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it, Fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tide pool, they found that above the clouds is where the night gets seriously moonlit.\
\
The light is darkly brilliant. There are different mountains up there, but they are mountains with their own white Arctic snows.\
\
They had emerged at the top of the high-stacked cumulonimbus, and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch eased Arthur in turn from his clothes, pried him free of them till all were gone, winding their surprised way down into the enveloping whiteness.\
\
She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T-shape, which might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one flown past, replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a little.\
\
There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the Greater Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the Constellation Fraz, and unlike the Boeing 747 which is in plentiful supply, they are, sadly, extinct, and the Universe shall never know their like again.\
\
The reason that a Boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or two later.\
\
They are big things, terrifyingly big. You know when one is in the air with you. There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and Fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in the Blitz.\
\
This time, however, there was no heart-sickening fall or loss of nerve, just a regrouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signaled through the buffeting noise.\
\
Mrs. E. Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts, was an elderly lady; indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end. She had seen a lot of it, been puzzled by some but, she was a little uneasy to feel at this late stage, bored by too much. It had all been very pleasant, but perhaps a little too explicable, a little too routine.\
\
With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shade and looked over the wing.\
\
At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then she thought, no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and her alone.\
\
By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an awful lot.\
\
She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong.\
\
\
The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored.\
\
The following night they did it all over again, only this time with Sony Walkmen.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 27\
\
\
This is all very wonderful,\'94 said Fenchurch a few days later, \'93but I do need to know what has happened to me. You see, there\'92s this difference between us. That you lost something and found it again, and I found something and lost it. I need to find it again.\'94\
\
She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day of telephoning.\
\
Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages and big print. It would be pleasant to be able to say that he was none the worse for this but, sadly, this was not the case. He happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so Arthur phoned him anyway.\
\
\'93Arthur, my old soup spoon, my old silver tureen, how particularly stunning to hear from you! Someone told me you\'92d gone off into space or something.\'94\
\
Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able to speak or even to follow. Hardly any of it meant anything at all. The bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalanche of nonsense. The time when you did find out, later, which bits he did mean, was often a bad time for all concerned.\
\
\'93What?\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93Just a rumor, my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card table, just a rumor. Probably means nothing at all, but I may need a quote from you.\'94\
\
\'93Nothing to say, just pub talk.\'94\
\
\'93We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it. Plus it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week, so it could be good just to have you denying it. Excuse me, something has just fallen out of my ear.\'94\
\
There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken.\
\
\'93Just remembered,\'94 he said, \'93what an odd evening I had last night. Anyway my old, I won\'92t say what, how do you feel about having ridden on Halley\'92s comet?\'94\
\
\'93I haven\'92t,\'94 said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, \'93ridden on Halley\'92s comet.\'94\
\
\'93Okay. How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley\'92s comet?\'94\
\
\'93Pretty relaxed, Murray.\'94\
\
There was a pause while Murray wrote this down.\
\
\'93Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and the chickens. Fits in with the general weirdness of the week. Week of the Weirdos, we\'92re thinking of calling it. Good, eh?\'94\
\
\'93Very good.\'94\
\
\'93Got a ring to it. First, we have this man it always rains on.\'94 \'93What?\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s the absolute stocking top truth. All documented in his little black books, it all checks out at every single fun-loving level. The Met Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds. This man is the bee\'92s knees, Arthur, he is the wasp\'92s nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world. We\'92re calling him the Rain God. Nice, eh?\'94\
\
\'93I think I\'92ve met him.\'94\
\
\'93Good ring to it. What did you say?\'94\
\
\'93I may have met him. Complains all the time, yes?\'94\
\
\'93Incredible! You met the Rain God?\'94\
\
\'93If it\'92s the same guy. I told him to stop complaining and show someone his book.\'94\
\
There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson\'92s end of the phone.\
\
\'93Well, you did a bundle. An absolute bundle has absolutely been done by you. Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean, forget irrigating the Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a whole new career ahead of him, just avoiding places for money. The man\'92s turning into a monster, Arthur, we might even have to make him win the bingo.\
\
\'93Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who Made the Rain God Rain. Got a ring to it, eh?\'94\
\
\'93A nice one, but\'97\'94\
\
\'93We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but that\'92ll be okay. Where are you?\'94\
\
\'93Er, I\'92m in Islington. Listen, Murray\'97\'94\
\
\'93Islington!\'94\
\
\'93Yes\'97\'94\
\
\'93Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real seriously loopy stuff. You know anything about these flying people?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93You must have. This is the real seethingly crazy one. This is the real meatballs in the batter. Locals are phoning in all the time to say there\'92s this couple who go flying nights. We\'92ve got guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine photograph. You must have heard.\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote. But that was months ago. Listen, it\'92s night after night this week, my old cheese grater, right on your patch. This couple just fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff. And I don\'92t mean looking through walls or pretending to be box-girder bridges. You don\'92t know anything?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Arthur, it\'92s been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with you, chumbum, but I have to go. I\'92ll send the guy with the camera and the hose. Give me the address, I\'92m ready and writing.\'94\
\
\'93Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something.\'94\
\
\'93I have a lot to do.\'94\
\
\'93I just wanted to find something about the dolphins.\'94\
\
\'93No story. Last year\'92s news. Forget \'92em. They\'92re gone.\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s important.\'94\
\
\'93Listen, no one will touch it. You can\'92t sustain a story, you know, when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever it is the story\'92s about. Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays. Maybe they\'92ll run a little \'91Whatever Happened to \'93Whatever Happened to the Dolphins\'94\'92 story in a couple of years, around August. But what\'92s anybody going to do now? \'91Dolphins Still Gone\'92? \'91Continuing Dolphin Absence\'92? \'91Dolphins\'97Further Days Without Them\'92? The story dies, Arthur. It lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat.\'94\
\
\'93Murray, I\'92m not interested in whether it\'92s a story. I just want to find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California who claims to know something about it. I thought you might know.\'94\
\
\

\
Chapter 28\
\
\
People are beginning to talk,\'94 said Fenchurch that evening, after they had hauled her cello in.\
\
\'93Not only talk,\'94 said Arthur, \'93but print, in big bold letters under the bingo prizes. Which is why I thought I\'92d better get these.\'94\
\
He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets.\
\
\'93Arthur!\'94 she said, hugging him, \'93does that mean you managed to talk to him?\'94\
\
\'93I have had a day,\'94 said Arthur, \'93of extreme telephonic exhaustion. I have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in Fleet Street, and I finally tracked his number down.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ve obviously been working hard, you\'92re drenched with sweat, poor darling.\'94\
\
\'93Not with sweat,\'94 said Arthur wearily. \'93A photographer\'92s just been here. I tried to argue, but\'97never mind, the point is, yes.\'94\
\
\'93You spoke to him.\'94\
\
\'93I spoke to his wife. She said he was too weird to come to the phone right now and could I call back.\'94\
\
He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something, and went to the fridge to find it.\
\
\'93Want a drink?\'94\
\
\'93Would commit murder to get one. I always know I\'92m in for a tough time when my cello teacher looks me up and down and says, \'91Ah yes, my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.\'92 \'94\
\
\'93I called again,\'94 said Arthur, \'93and she said that he was 3.2 light-years from the phone and I should call back.\'94\
\
\'93Ah.\'94\
\
\'93I called again. She said the situation had improved. He was now a mere 2.6 light-years from the phone but it was still a long way to shout.\'94\
\
\'93You don\'92t suppose,\'94 said Fenchurch doubtfully, \'93that there\'92s anyone else we can talk to?\'94\
\
\'93It gets worse,\'94 said Arthur. \'93I spoke to someone on a science magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson will not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof, often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl footwear, that the month\'92s most fashionable silly theory is true. For people who question the validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and that\'92s as far as you get.\'94\
\
\'93I didn\'92t realize it was that bad,\'94 said Fenchurch quietly. She fiddled listlessly with the tickets.\
\
\'93I phoned Mrs. Watson again,\'94 said Arthur. \'93Her name, by the way, and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill.\'94\
\
\'93I see.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m glad you see. I thought you mightn\'92t believe any of this, so when I called her this time I used the telephone answering machine to record the call with.\'94\
\
He went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which was particularly recommended by Which magazine and is almost impossible to use without going mad.\
\
\'93Here it is,\'94 he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow.\
\
The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite and back, but was also hauntingly calm.\
\
\'93Perhaps I should explain,\'94 Arcane Jill Watson\'92s voice said, \'93that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into. It\'92s in the Asylum, you see. Wonko the Sane does not like to enter the Asylum and so he does not. I feel you should know this because it may save you phoning. If you would like to meet him, this is very easily arranged. All you have to do is walk in. He will only meet people outside the Asylum.\'94\
\
Arthur\'92s voice, at its most mystified: \'93I\'92m sorry, I don\'92t understand. Where is the asylum?\'94\
\
\'93Where is the Asylum?\'94 Arcane Jill Watson again. \'93Have you ever read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?\'94\
\
On the tape, Arthur\'92s voice had to admit that he had not.\
\
\'93You may want to do that. You may find that it clarifies things for you a little. You may find that it indicates to you where the Asylum is. Thank you.\'94\
\
The sound of the phone line went dead. Arthur turned the machine off.\
\
\'93Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation,\'94 he said with a shrug. \'93I actually managed to get the address from the guy on the science magazine.\'94\
\
Fenchurch looked up at him with a thoughtful frown, and looked at the tickets again.\
\
\'93Do you think it\'92s worth it?\'94 she said.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Arthur, \'93the one thing that everyone I spoke to agreed on, apart from the fact they all thought he was barking mad, is that he does know more than any man living about dolphins.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 29\
\
\
This is an important announcement. This is flight 121 to Los Angeles. If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles, now would be a perfect time to disembark.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 30\
\
\
They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that rents out cars that other people have thrown away.\
\
\'93Getting it to go around corners is a bit of a problem,\'94 said the guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys. \'93Sometimes it\'92s simpler just to get out and find a car that\'92s going in that direction.\'94\
\
They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by.\
\
\'93Everyone there is either English or odd or both. They\'92ve got a swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers.\'94\
\
It was true. There was one and that was exactly what he was doing.\
\
The garage attendant didn\'92t think much of their car, but that was fine because they didn\'92t either.\
\
Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San Fernando Valley. They agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didn\'92t touch any other part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle. As dramatic seas of light went, it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they didn\'92t think much of it.\
\
They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was unbearably hot.\
\
They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at.\
\
\'93Someone told me,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93that they once overheard two ladies on this beach, doing what we\'92re doing, looking at the Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives. And apparently, after a long pause, one of them said to the other, \'91You know, it\'92s not as big as I expected.\'92 \'94\
\
Their mood gradually lifted as they walked along the beach in Malibu and watched all the millionaires in their chic shanty huts carefully keeping an eye on one another to check how rich they were each getting.\
\
Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving toward a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city like Los Angeles in front of they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didn\'92t even mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations, and those simultaneously. So what, they were both playing good rock and roll.\
\
\'93I know that he will be able to help us,\'94 said Fenchurch determinedly, \'93I know he will. What\'92s his name again, the one he likes to be called?\'94\
\
\'93Wonko the Sane.\'94\
\
\'93I know that he will be able to help us.\'94\
\
Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth, whatever this Earth might prove to be.\
\
He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine, that he would not be called upon to try to remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at him.\
\
\
In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed to be a converted warehouse.\
\
Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious.\
\
Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry. He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her.\
\
\'93Why\'92s this fish so bloody good?\'94 he demanded, angrily.\
\
\'93Please excuse my friend,\'94 said Fenchurch to the startled waitress. \'93I think he\'92s having a nice day at last.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 31\
\
\
If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something which didn\'92t exactly look like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar.\
\
He was tall and he gangled.\
\
When he sat in his deck chair gazing at the Pacific, not so much with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deck chair ended and he began, and you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off. But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable. It seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you, but which when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order on his face made you suddenly feel \'93Oh. Well, that\'92s all right then.\'94\
\
When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made you feel \'93Oh. Well, that\'92s all right then\'94 pretty often.\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 he said, \'93they come and see me. They sit right here. They sit right where you\'92re sitting.\'94 He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl sandals.\
\
\'93They eat nachos which they say they can\'92t get where they come from. They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things.\'94\
\
\'93Do they,\'94 said Arthur, \'93are they? So, er \'85 when is this then? When do they come?\'94\
\
He gazed out at the Pacific as well. There were little sandpipers running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had just washed over, but they couldn\'92t bear to get their feet wet. To deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if they\'92d been constructed by somebody very clever in Switzerland.\
\
Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers.\
\
\'93Weekends, mostly,\'94 said Wonko the Sane, \'93on little scooters. They are great machines.\'94 He smiled.\
\
\'93I see,\'94 said Arthur, \'93I see.\'94\
\
A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at her. She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the sand of the two of them in the clouds. For a moment he thought she was trying to get him excited, then he realized that she was rebuking him. \'93Who are we,\'94 she was saying, \'93to say he\'92s mad?\'94\
\
His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like.\
\
It was like this:\
\
It was inside out.\
\
Actually inside out, to the extent that they had had to park on the carpet.\
\
All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was decorated in a tasteful interior-designed pink, were bookshelves, also a couple of those odd three-legged tables with semicircular tops which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped the wall straight through them, and pictures which were clearly designed to soothe.\
\
Where it got really odd was the roof.\
\
It folded back on itself like something that M. C. Escher, had he been given to hard nights on the town, which it is no part of this narrative\'92s purpose to suggest was the case, though it is sometimes hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one with all the awkward steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up after having been on one, for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up.\
\
Confusing.\
\
The sign above the front door read \'93Come Outside,\'94 and so, nervously, they had.\
\
Inside, of course, was where the Outside was. Rough brickwork, nicely done pointing, gutters in good repair, a garden path, a couple of small trees, some rooms leading off.\
\
And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had M. C. Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to enclose the Pacific Ocean itself.\
\
\'93Hello,\'94 said John Watson, Wonko the Sane.\
\
Good, they thought to themselves, \'93hello\'94 is something we can cope with.\
\
\'93Hello,\'94 they said, and all, surprisingly, was smiles.\
\
For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, \'93I forget \'85\'94 whenever they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly round the eccentricities of his house.\
\
\'93It gives me pleasure,\'94 he said, \'93in a curious kind of way, and does nobody any harm,\'94 he continued, \'93that a competent optician couldn\'92t correct.\'94\
\
They liked him. He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able to mock himself before anybody else did.\
\
\'93Your wife,\'94 said Arthur, looking around, \'93mentioned some toothpicks.\'94 He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried that she might suddenly leap out from behind a door and mention them again.\
\
Wonko the Sane laughed. It was a light easy laugh, and sounded like one he had used a lot before and was happy with.\
\
\'93Ah yes,\'94 he said, \'93that\'92s to do with the day I finally realized that the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put it in, poor thing, and hoped it would get better.\'94\
\
This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous again.\
\
\'93Here,\'94 said Wonko the Sane, \'93we are outside the Asylum.\'94 He pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing, and the gutters. \'93Go through that door\'94\'97he pointed at the first door through which they had originally entered\'97\'93and you go into the Asylum. I\'92ve tried to decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy, but there\'92s very little one can do. I never go in there myself. If ever I am tempted, which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the door and I shy away.\'94\
\
\'93That one?\'94 said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue plaque with some instructions written on it.\
\
\'93Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what I had to do.\'94\
\
The sign read:\
\
\'93Hold stick near center of its length. Moisten pointed end in mouth. Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in-out motion.\'94\
\
\'93It seemed to me,\'94 said Wonko the Sane, \'93that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a package of toothpicks, was no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane.\'94\
\
He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers.\
\
\'93And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it possibly might, I am completely sane. Which is why I call myself Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point. Wonko is what my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over, and sane is what I am, and how,\'94 he added, with one of his smiles that made you feel \'93Oh. Well, that\'92s all right then, I intend to remain. Shall we go to the beach and see what we have to talk about?\'94\
\
They went out onto the beach, which was where he started talking about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl sandals.\
\
\'93About the dolphins \'85\'94 said Fenchurch gently, hopefully.\
\
\'93I can show you the sandals,\'94 said Wonko the Sane.\
\
\'93I wonder, do you know.\
\
\'93Would you like me to show you,\'94 said Wonko the Sane, \'93the sandals? I have them. I\'92ll get them. They are made by the Dr. Scholl company, and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in. They say they run a concession stand by the message. When I say I don\'92t know what that means they say no, you don\'92t, and laugh. Well, I\'92ll get them anyway.\'94\
\
As he walked back toward the inside, or the outside depending on how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand.\
\
\'93How are the feet today?\'94 said Arthur quietly.\
\
\'93Okay. It doesn\'92t feel so odd in the sand. Or in the water. The water touches them perfectly. I just think this isn\'92t our world.\'94\
\
She shrugged. \'93What do you think he meant,\'94 she said, \'93by the message?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know,\'94 said Arthur, though the memory of a man called Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him.\
\
When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned Arthur. Not the sandals; they were perfectly ordinary wooden-bottomed sandals.\
\
\'93I just thought you\'92d like to see,\'94 he said, \'93what angels wear on their feet. Just out of curiosity. I\'92m not trying to prove anything, by the way. I\'92m a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If he sees a thing, he must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not. See first, think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists forget that. I\'92ll show you something to demonstrate that later. So, the other reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think I am a fool. That allows me to say what I see when I see it. You can\'92t possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that you\'92re a fool. Anyway, I also thought you might like to see this.\'94\
\
This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him carrying, for it was a wonderfully silver-gray glass fishbowl, seemingly identical to the one in Arthur\'92s bedroom.\
\
Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without success, to say \'93Where did you get that?\'94 sharply, and with a gasp in his voice.\
\
Finally his time had come but he missed it by a millisecond.\
\
\'93Where did you get that?\'94 said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp in her voice.\
\
Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said, \'93What? Have you seen one of these before?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 she said, \'93I\'92ve got one. Or at least did have. Russell stole it to put his golf balls in. I don\'92t know where it came from, just that I was angry with Russell for stealing it. Why, have you got one?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, it was \'85\'94\
\
They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing sharply backward and forward between them, and trying to get a gasp in edgeways. \'93You have one of these, too?\'94 he said to both of them.\
\
\'93Yes.\'94 They both said it.\
\
He looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the bowl to catch the light of the California sun.\
\
The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them. He turned it and turned it. They could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words \'93So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.\'94\
\
\'93Do you know,\'94 asked Wonko quietly, \'93what it is?\'94\
\
They shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the gray glass.\
\
\'93It is a farewell gift from the dolphins,\'94 said Wonko in a low quiet voice, \'93the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam with, and fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language, a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult, considering the fact that I now realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to.\'94\
\
He shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur.\
\
\'93Have you \'85\'94 he said to Arthur, \'93what have you done with yours? May I ask you that?\'94\
\
\'93Er, I keep a fish in it,\'94 said Arthur, slightly embarrassed. \'93I happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and, er, there was this bowl.\'94 He tailed off.\
\
\'93You\'92ve done nothing else? No,\'94 he said, \'93if you had, you would know.\'94 He shook his head again.\
\
\'93My wife kept wheat germ in ours,\'94 resumed Wonko, with some new tone in his voice, \'93until last night.\'85\'94\
\
\'93What,\'94 said Arthur slowly and hushedly, \'93happened last night?\'94\
\
\'93We ran out of wheat germ,\'94 said Wonko, evenly. \'93My wife,\'94 he added, \'93has gone to get some more.\'94 He seemed lost with his own thoughts for a moment.\
\
\'93And what happened then?\'94 said Fenchurch, in the same breathless tone.\
\
\'93I washed it,\'94 said Wonko. \'93I washed it very carefully, very, very carefully, removing every last speck of wheat germ, then I dried it slowly with a lint-free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it over and over. Then I held it to my ear. Have you \'85 have you held one to your ear?\'94\
\
They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly.\
\
\'93Perhaps,\'94 he said, \'93you should.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 32\
\
\
The deep roar of the ocean.\
\
The break of waves on farther shores than thought can find.\
\
The silent thunders of the deep.\
\
And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming trillings, wordlings, and half-articulated songs of thought.\
\
Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the inarticulate, words breaking together.\
\
A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth.\
\
Waves of joy on\'97where? A world indescribably found, indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water.\
\
A fugue of voices now, clamoring explanations, of a disaster unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words.\
\
And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the fight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone.\
\
Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear.\
\
\'93This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the Humans. We bid you farewell.\'94\
\
And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly gray bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 33\
\
\
That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from inside it.\
\
\'93This is what I wanted you to see,\'94 said Wonko the Sane when the news came around again, \'93an old colleague of mine. He\'92s over in your country running an investigation. Just watch.\'94\
\
It was a press conference.\
\
\'93I\'92m afraid I can\'92t comment on the name Rain God at this present time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para-Causal Meteorological Phenomenon.\'94\
\
\'93Can you tell us what that means?\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m not altogether sure. Let\'92s be straight here. If we find something we can\'92t understand we like to call it something you can\'92t understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go around calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something we don\'92t, and I\'92m afraid we couldn\'92t have that.\
\
\'93No, first we have to call it something which says it\'92s ours, not yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it\'92s not what you said it is, but something we say it is.\
\
\'93And if it turns out that you\'92re right, you\'92ll still be wrong, because we will simply call him a \'85 er, \'91Supernormal\'92\'97not paranormal or supernatural because you think you know what those mean now, no, a \'91Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer.\'92 We\'92ll probably want to shove a \'91Quasi\'92 in there somewhere to protect ourselves. Rain God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life. Admittedly, you wouldn\'92t catch me going on holiday with him. Thanks, that\'92ll be all for now, other than to say \'91Hi!\'92 to Wonko if he\'92s watching.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 34\
\
\
On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the plane who was looking at them rather oddly.\
\
They talked quietly to themselves.\
\
\'93I still have to know,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93and I strongly feel that you know something that you\'92re not telling me.\'94\
\
Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper.\
\
\'93Do you have a pencil?\'94 he said.\
\
She dug around and found one.\
\
\'93What are you doing, sweetheart?\'94 she said, after he had spent twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil again, and grunting irritably to himself.\
\
\'93Trying to remember an address someone once gave me.\'94\
\
\'93Your life would be an awful lot simpler,\'94 she said, \'93if you bought yourself an address book.\'94\
\
Finally he passed the paper to her.\
\
\'93You look after it,\'94 he said.\
\
She looked at it. Among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words \'93Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. Sevorbeupstry. Planet of Preliumtarn. Sun-Zarss. Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma.\'94\
\
\'93And what\'92s there?\'94\
\
\'93Apparently,\'94 said Arthur, \'93it\'92s God\'92s Final Message to His Creation.\'94\
\
\'93That sounds a bit more like it,\'94 said Fenchurch. \'93How do we get there?\'94\
\
\'93You really \'85?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Fenchurch firmly, \'93I really want to know.\'94\
\
Arthur looked out of the little scratchy Plexiglas window at the open sky outside.\
\
\'93Excuse me,\'94 said the woman who had been looking at them rather oddly, suddenly, \'93I hope you don\'92t think I\'92m rude. I get so bored on these long flights, it\'92s nice to talk to somebody. My name\'92s Enid Kapelsen, I\'92m from Boston. Tell me, do you fly a lot?\'94\

Chapter 35\
\
\
They went to Arthur\'92s house in the West Country, shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every galactic hitchhiker ends up spending most of his time doing.\
\
They waited for a flying saucer to come by.\
\
\'93Friend of mine did this for fifteen years,\'94 said Arthur one night as they sat forlornly watching the sky.\
\
\'93Who was that?\'94\
\
\'93Called Ford Prefect.\'94\
\
He caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again.\
\
He wondered where Ford Prefect was.\
\
By an extraordinary coincidence the following day there were two reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incident with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in pubs.\
\
Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hungover and complaining that Arthur never answered the phone.\
\
In fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he\'92d been pulled through a hedge backward, but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled backward through a combine harvester. He staggered into Arthur\'92s sitting room, waving aside all offers of support, which was an error, because the effort of waving caused him to lose his balance altogether and Arthur eventually had to drag him to the sofa.\
\
\'93Thank you,\'94 said Ford, \'93thank you very much. Have you \'85\'94 he said, and fell asleep for three hours.\
\
\'93 \'85 the faintest idea,\'94 he continued suddenly, when he revived, \'93how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Pleiades? I can see that you haven\'92t, so I\'92ll tell you,\'94 he said, \'93over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to make me.\'94\
\
He followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen.\
\
\'93Stupid operators keep asking you where you\'92re calling from and you try and tell them Letchworth and they say you couldn\'92t be if you\'92re coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?\'94\
\
\'93Making you some black coffee.\'94\
\
\'93Oh.\'94 Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place forlornly.\
\
\'93What\'92s this?\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Rice Krispies.\'94\
\
\'93And this?\'94\
\
\'93Paprika.\'94\
\
\'93I see,\'94 said Ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down, on top of the other, but that didn\'92t seem to balance properly, so he put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work.\
\
\'93A little space-lagged,\'94 he said. \'93What was I saying?\'94\
\
\'93About not phoning from Letchworth.\'94\
\
\'93I wasn\'92t. I explained this to the lady. \'91Bugger Letchworth,\'92 I said, \'91if that\'92s your attitude. I am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the sub-light-speed leg of a journey between the stars known to your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady.\'92 I said \'91dear lady,\'92 \'94 explained Ford Prefect, \'93because I didn\'92t want her to be offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin\'97\'94\
\
\'93Tactful,\'94 said Arthur Dent.\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said Ford, \'93tactful.\'94\
\
He frowned.\
\
\'93Space-lag,\'94 he said, \'93is very bad for sub-clauses. You\'92ll have to assist me again,\'94 he continued, \'93by reminding me what I was talking about.\'94\
\
\'93 \'91Between the stars,\'92 \'94 said Arthur, \'93 \'91known to your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady, as\'97\'92 \'94\
\
\'93Pleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta,\'94 concluded Ford triumphantly. \'93This conversation lark is quite a gas, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93Have some coffee.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, no. \'91And the reason,\'92 I said, \'91why I am bothering you with it rather than just dialing direct as I could, because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny-pinching son of a starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast starship insists that I call collect. Can you believe that?\'92 \'94\
\
\'93And could she?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know. She had hung up,\'94 said Ford, \'93by this time. So! What do you suppose,\'94 he asked fiercely, \'93I did next?\'94\
\
\'93I\'92ve no idea, Ford,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93Pity,\'94 said Ford, \'93I was hoping you could remind me. I really hate those guys, you know. They really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing round the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly or, when they do, perform functions that no sane man would require of them and,\'94 he added savagely, \'93go beep to tell you when they\'92ve done it!\'94\
\
This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by right-thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being right-thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view.\
\
The Hitchhiker\'92s Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy-three thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that \'93it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all.\
\
\'93In other words\'97and this is the rock-solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation\'92s Galaxywide success is founded\'97their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws. \'93\
\
\'93And this guy,\'94 ranted Ford, \'93was on a drive to sell more of them! His five-year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their restaurants, elevators, and wine bars! Or if they didn\'92t have restaurants, elevators, and wine bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have! Where\'92s that coffee!\'94\
\
\'93I threw it away.\'94\
\
\'93Make some more. I have now remembered what I did next. I saved civilization as we know. I knew it was something like that.\'94\
\
He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and making beep-beep noises.\
\
A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur followed him.\
\
Ford looked stunned.\
\
\'93Where have you been?\'94 he demanded.\
\
\'93Making some coffee,\'94 said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face. He had long ago realized that the only way of being in Ford\'92s company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear them at all times.\
\
\'93You missed the best bit!\'94 raged Ford. \'93You missed the bit where I jumped the guy! Now,\'94 he said, \'93I shall have to jump him all over again!\'94\
\
He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it.\
\
\'93It was better,\'94 he said sullenly, \'93last time,\'94 and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining table.\
\
\'93I see,\'94 said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed-up wreckage, \'93and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 screamed Ford. \'93What? You missed that bit, too? That\'92s the suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended animation facility. Well, I had to, didn\'92t I?\'94\
\
\'93So it would seem,\'94 said Arthur, in his placid voice.\
\
\'93Don\'92t touch that!!!\'94 yelled Ford.\
\
Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly.\
\
\'93Okay,\'94 said Ford, calming down, \'93listen to it.\'94\
\
Arthur put the phone to his ear.\
\
\'93It\'92s the speaking clock,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Beep, beep, beep,\'94 said Ford, \'93beep, beep, beep.\'94\
\
\'93I see,\'94 said Arthur, with every ounce of placidness he could muster.\
\
\'93Beep, beep, beep,\'94 said Ford, \'93is exactly what is being heard all over that guy\'92s ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a little known moon of Sesefras Magna. The London speaking clock!\'94\
\
\'93I see,\'94 said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to ask the big one.\
\
\'93Why?\'94 he said, acidly.\
\
\'93With a bit of luck,\'94 said Ford, \'93the phone bill will bankrupt the buggers.\'94\
\
He threw himself, sweating, onto the sofa.\
\
\'93Anyway,\'94 he said, \'93dramatic arrival, don\'92t you think?\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 36\
\
\
The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had stunned the world.\
\
Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs.\
\
This time it was real, it was definite. It was quite definitely definite.\
\
It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world, including much of Harrods.\
\
The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in color, pitted, scorched, and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man.\
\
A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Harrods Food Halls, demolished Harvey Nichols, and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture, toppled the Sheraton Park Tower.\
\
After a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall.\
\
It held up a hand.\
\
\'93I come in peace,\'94 it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, \'93take me to your Lizard.\'94\
\
Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with Arthur and watched the nonstop frenetic news reports on television, none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting short incomprehensible error messages.\
\
\'93It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see.\'85\'94\
\
\'93You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, \'93nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.\'94\
\
\'93Odd,\'94 said Arthur, \'93I thought you said it was a democracy.\'94\
\
\'93I did,\'94 said Ford. \'93It is.\'94\
\
\'93So,\'94 said Arthur, hoping he wasn\'92t sounding ridiculously obtuse, \'93why don\'92t the people get rid of the lizards?\'94\
\
\'93It honestly doesn\'92t occur to them,\'94 said Ford. \'93They\'92ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they\'92ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.\'94\
\
\'93You mean they actually vote for the lizards?\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 said Ford with a shrug, \'93of course.\'94\
\
\'93But,\'94 said Arthur, going for the big one again, \'93why?\'94\
\
\'93Because if they didn\'92t vote for a lizard,\'94 said Ford, \'93the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93I said,\'94 said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, \'93have you got any gin?\'94\
\
\'93I\'92ll look. Tell me about the lizards.\'94\
\
Ford shrugged again.\
\
\'93Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,\'94 he said. \'93They\'92re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone\'92s got to say it.\'94\
\
\'93But that\'92s terrible,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93Listen, bud,\'94 said Ford, \'93if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say \'91That\'92s terrible\'92 I wouldn\'92t be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin. But I haven\'92t and I am. Anyway, what are you looking so placid and moon-eyed for? Are you in love?\'94\
\
Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly.\
\
\'93With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to meet her?\'94\
\
He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers she\'92d been into the village to buy. She stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from Betelgeuse on the sofa.\
\
\'93Where\'92s the gin?\'94 said Ford to Fenchurch, and to Arthur, \'93What happened to Trillian, by the way?\'94\
\
\'93Er, this is Fenchurch,\'94 said Arthur, awkwardly. \'93There was nothing with Trillian, you must have seen her last.\'94\
\
\'93Oh yeah,\'94 said Ford, \'93she went off with Zaphod somewhere. They had some kids or something. At least,\'94 he added, \'93I think that\'92s what they were. Zaphod\'92s calmed down a lot, you know.\'94\
\
\'93Really?\'94 said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping.\
\
\'93Yeah,\'94 said Ford, \'93at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid.\'94\
\
\'93Arthur, who is this?\'94 said Fenchurch.\
\
\'93Ford Prefect,\'94 said Arthur. \'93I may have mentioned him in passing.\'94\

\
Chapter 37\
\
\
For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things. Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it all, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it\'97but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon slowly.\
\
At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing.\
\
It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion.\
\
It would have to send out its service robots.\
\
It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number of problems.\
\
The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the surrounding terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others.\
\
One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived.\
\
A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the zoo in Regent\'92s Park, and most particularly the reptile house.\
\
Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the pet shop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high-level talks with them.\
\
Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, frank, and wide-ranging exchange of views, the high-level talks had broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot, would take a short holiday somewhere and for some reason selected Bournemouth.\
\
Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another beer. Immediate preparations were made for its departure.\
\
The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout the day and all through the nighttime, and in the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll westward on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry.\
\
Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival buzzed around by its servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed itself of its transport system\'92s embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach.\
\
It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to Bournemouth.\
\
Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out and guarded as the robot\'92s recreation area, and tried to see what it was doing.\
\
Motorboats prowled up and down the shore to see what it was doing.\
\
It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a little awkwardly on its face.\
\
It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed to do what no one else in the world so far had managed, which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service robots guarding the perimeter.\
\
It was an extraordinary breakthrough.\
\
\'93I think there\'92s a story in it,\'94 confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel-link fence, \'93but it needs a good local angle. I\'92ve got a little list of questions here,\'94 he went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket. \'93Perhaps you could get him, it, whatever you call him, to run through them quickly.\'94\
\
The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it could do and screeched off.\
\
A reply was never forthcoming.\
\
Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the massive battle-scarred industrial-quality circuits of the robot\'92s mind. They were these:\
\
\'93How do you feel about being a robot?\'94\
\
\'93How does it feel to be from outer space?\'94 and,\
\
\'93How do you like Bournemouth?\'94\
\
Early the following day things started to be packed up and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good.\
\
\'93The point is,\'94 said Fenchurch to Ford, \'93can you get us on board?\'94\
\
Ford looked wildly at his watch.\
\
\'93I have some serious unfinished business to attend to,\'94 he exclaimed.\
\
\
\
\
\
Chapter 38\
\
\
Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service robots. Staked out around that was the army, which had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them. They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from the public, or to guarantee the giant ship\'92s diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate.\
\
The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The army stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it were simply going to get up and go.\
\
The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o\'92clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it. Much had been heard\'97more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives, and now it was simply going to go without them.\
\
Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there.\
\
\'93How reliable is he?\'94 asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice.\
\
\'93How reliable?\'94 asked Arthur. He gave a hollow laugh. \'93How shallow is the ocean?\'94 he asked. \'93How cold is the sun?\'94\
\
The last parts of the robot\'92s gantry transport were being carried on board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them. The soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of course, could be done about any of it.\
\
Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them nowhere.\
\
And within a few minutes, nothing remained outside the ship; every last link of the fence was aboard. A couple of flying fretsaws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves.\
\
A few seconds passed.\
\
The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the Harrods Food Halls. The sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored.\
\
\'93Hold it!\'94\
\
A megaphone barked from a taxi that screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd.\
\
\'93There has been,\'94 barked the megaphone, \'93a major scientific break-in! Through. Breakthrough,\'94 it corrected itself. The door flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat.\
\
\'93Hold it!\'94 he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squat black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly, the ramp paused in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals from the Thumb (which half the electronic engineers in the Galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals), slowly ground its way downward again.\
\
Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it.\
\
\'93Make way,\'94 he shouted, \'93make way, please, this is a major scientific breakthrough! You and you, get the equipment from the taxi.\'94\
\
Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi.\
\
\'93All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important pieces of scientific equipment,\'94 boomed Ford. \'93Just everybody keep calm. It\'92s all under control, there\'92s nothing to see. It is merely a major scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now. Important scientific equipment. Clear the way.\'94\
\
Hungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up.\
\
Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi.\
\
\'93Hang your coat over them,\'94 he muttered to Fenchurch as he heaved them out to her. Hurriedly, he maneuvered out the large supermarket cart that was also jammed against the back seat. It clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it.\
\
\'93Clear a path, please,\'94 shouted Ford again. \'93Everything\'92s under proper scientific control.\'94\
\
\'93He said you\'92d pay,\'94 said the taxi driver to Arthur, who dug out some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police sirens.\
\
\'93Move along there,\'94 shouted Ford, \'93and no one will get hurt.\'94\
\
The crowd, surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket cart through the rubble toward the ramp.\
\
\'93It\'92s all right,\'94 Ford continued to bellow. \'93There\'92s nothing to see, it\'92s all over. None of this is actually happening.\'94\
\
\'93Clear the way, please,\'94 boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd. \'93There\'92s been a break-in, clear the way.\'94\
\
\'93Breakthrough,\'94 yelled Ford in competition. \'93A scientific breakthrough.\'94\
\
\'93This is the police! Clear the way!\'94\
\
\'93Scientific equipment! Clear the way!\'94\
\
\'93Police! Let us through!\'94\
\
\'93Walkmen!\'94 yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket cart to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up onto the lip of it.\
\
\'93Hold tight,\'94 muttered Ford, and released a button on his Electronic Thumb. Beneath them, the huge ramp shuddered and began slowly to heave its way upward.\
\
\'93OK, kids,\'94 he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship, \'93looks like we\'92re on our way.\'94\

Chapter 39\
\
\
Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire.\
\
Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway that they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself down the access ladder, and prowled the corridors moodily.\
\
They were claustrophobic and ill-lit. The lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly.\
\
That wasn\'92t it, though.\
\
He paused and leaned backward as a flying power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a screech, occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee.\
\
That wasn\'92t it either.\
\
He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a large corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he walked toward the other.\
\
He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened but still badly scratched Plexiglas.\
\
\'93Would you turn it down please?\'94 he asked Ford Prefect who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment he\'92d taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a heap of empty beer cans.\
\
\'93Shhhh!\'94 hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven.\
\
\'93Just a bit,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
\'93No!\'94 shouted Ford. \'93We\'92re just getting to the good bit! Listen, I finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion, everything, and this is the good bit!\'94\
\
With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit. He listened to Ford\'92s whoops and yells and yeeehays as placidly as he could.\
\
\'93Ford,\'94 he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca, \'93how come, if \'85 \'93\
\
\'93This is the big one,\'94 said Ford. \'93This is the one I came back for. Do you realize I never saw it all the way through? I always missed the end. I saw half of it again the night before the Vogons came. When they blew the place up I thought I\'92d never get to see it. Hey, what happened with all that anyway?\'94\
\
\'93Just life,\'94 said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six-pack.\
\
\'93Oh, that again,\'94 said Ford. \'93I thought it might be something like that. I prefer this stuff,\'94 he said as Rick\'92s bar flickered onto the screen. \'93How come if what?\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93You started to say, \'91how come if \'85 \'92 \'94\
\
\'93How come if you\'92re so rude about the Earth, that you \'85 Oh, never mind, let\'92s just watch the movie.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said Ford.\

Chapter 40\
\

There remains little still to tell.\
\
Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of Flanux until the Gray Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were discovered lying behind them, lie the Gray Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine.\
\
Within the Gray Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the star named Zarss, around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn in which is the land of Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of Sevorbeupstry that Arthur and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey.\
\
And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red Plain of Rars, which was bounded on the south side by the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, on the farther side of which, according to the dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty-foot-high letters of fire God\'92s Final Message to His Creation.\
\
According to Prak, if Arthur\'92s memory served him right, the place was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a manner, it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them a ticket.\
\
\'93Keep to the left, please,\'94 he said, \'93keep to the left,\'94 and hurried past them on a little scooter.\
\
They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the path that led around the left of the Great Red Plain was well worn and dotted with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain, which was heated by the fire of the letters that formed God\'92s Final Message to His Creation. At another they bought some postcards. The letters had been blurred with an airbrush, \'93So as not to spoil the Big Surprise!\'94 it said on the reverse.\
\
\'93Do you know what the message is?\'94 they asked the wizened little lady in the booth.\
\
\'93Oh yes,\'94 she piped cheerily, \'93oh yes!\'94\
\
She waved them on.\
\
Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red Plain rippled in the heat.\
\
\'93Is it possible,\'94 asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, \'93to rent one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic Ventrawhatsit had?\'94\
\
\'93The scooters,\'94 said the little lady who was serving at the ice cream bar, \'93are not for the devout.\'94\
\
\'93Oh well, that\'92s easy then,\'94 said Fenchurch, \'93we\'92re not particularly devout. We\'92re just interested.\'94\
\
\'93Then you must turn back now,\'94 said the little lady severely, and when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sun hats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the Great Red Plain of Rars.\
\
They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out into the sun again.\
\
\'93We\'92re running out of barrier cream,\'94 said Fenchurch after a few more miles. \'93We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our steps.\'94\
\
They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat haze; they looked behind themselves. They elected to go on.\
\
They then discovered that they were not only not the first to make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making it now.\
\
Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half limping, half crawling.\
\
It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred, and twisted metal.\
\
It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot, dry dust.\
\
\'93So much time,\'94 it groaned, \'93oh, so much time. And pain as well, so much of that, and so much time to suffer in it, too. One or the other on its own I could probably manage. It\'92s the two together that really get me down. Oh, hello, you again.\'94\
\
\'93Marvin?\'94 said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it. \'93Is that you?\'94\
\
\'93You were always one,\'94 groaned the aged husk of the robot, \'93for the superintelligent question, weren\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93What is it?\'94 whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind Arthur, and grasping his arm.\
\
\'93He\'92s sort of an old friend,\'94 said Arthur, \'93I\'97\'94\
\
\'93Friend!\'94 croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away in a kind of dry crackle and flakes of rust fell out of his mouth. \'93You\'92ll have to excuse me while I try and remember what the word means. My memory banks are not what they were, you know, and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory backup. Ah, here it comes.\'94\
\
The robot\'92s battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought.\
\
\'93Hmm,\'94 he said, \'93what a curious concept.\'94\
\
He thought a little longer.\
\
\'93No,\'94 he said at last, \'93don\'92t think I ever came across one of those. Sorry, can\'92t help you there.\'94\
\
He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, and then tried to twist himself up onto his misshapen elbows.\
\
\'93Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you perhaps?\'94 he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. \'93A piece of paper that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you would like me,\'94 he continued, \'93to open a door?\'94\
\
His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to scan the distant horizon.\
\
\'93Don\'92t seem to be any doors around at present,\'94 he said, \'93but I\'92m sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one. And then,\'94 he said slowly, twisting his head around to see Arthur again, \'93I could open it for you. I\'92m quite used to waiting, you know.\'94\
\
\'93Arthur,\'94 hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, \'93you never told me of this. What have you done to this poor creature?\'94\
\
\'93Nothing,\'94 insisted Arthur sadly, \'93he\'92s always like this\'97\'94\
\
\'93Ha!\'94 snapped Marvin. \'93Ha!\'94 he repeated, \'93what do you know of always? You say \'91always\'92 to me, who, because of the silly little errands your organic life forms keep on sending me through time on, am now thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words with a little more care,\'94 he coughed, \'93and tact.\'94\
\
He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed.\
\
\'93Leave me,\'94 he said, \'93go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully on my way. My time at last is nearly come. My race is nearly run. I fully expect,\'94 he said, feebly waving them on with a broken finger, \'93to come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am, brain the size\'97\'94\
\
\'93Shut up,\'94 said Arthur.\
\
Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he weighed now surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms.\
\
They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the Great Red Plain of Rars toward the south-encircling mountains of Quentulus Quazgar.\
\
Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often interrupted by Marvin\'92s dolorous cybernetic ravings.\
\
They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths, and some soothing oil, but Marvin would have none of it.\
\
\'93I\'92m all spare parts,\'94 he droned.\
\
\'93Let me be!\'94 he groaned.\
\
\'93Every part of me,\'94 he moaned, \'93has been replaced at least fifty times \'85 except \'85\'94 He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment. His head bobbed between them with the effort of memory. \'93Do you remember, the first time you ever met me,\'94 he said at last to Arthur, \'93I had been given the intellect-stretching task of taking you up to the bridge? I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side? That I had asked for them to be replaced but they never were?\'94\
\
He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move, let alone set.\
\
\'93See if you can guess,\'94 said Marvin, when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough, \'93which parts of me were never replaced? Go on, see if you can guess.\
\
\'93Ouch,\'94 he added, \'93ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.\'94\
\
At last they reached the last of the little booths, set Marvin down between them, and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought some cuff links for Russell, cuff links that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in which were written God\'92s Final Message to His Creation.\
\
Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message.\
\
\'93Ready?\'94 he said to Fenchurch, who nodded.\
\
They heaved up Marvin between them.\
\
They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the mountain. There was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a good view. It had a little pay telescope for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve.\
\
They gazed at God\'92s Final Message to His Creation in wonderment, and were slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and complete understanding.\
\
Fenchurch sighed. \'93Yes,\'94 she said, \'93that was it.\'94\
\
They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision circuits had almost gone.\
\
They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn. The first letter was a \'93w,\'94 the second an \'93e.\'94 Then there was a gap. An \'93a\'94 followed, then a \'93p,\'94 an \'93o,\'94 and an \'93l.\'94\
\
Marvin paused for a rest.\
\
After a few moments they resumed and let him see the \'93o,\'94 the \'93g,\'94 the \'93i,\'94 the \'93z,\'94 and the \'93e.\'94\
\
The next two words were \'93for\'94 and \'93the.\'94 The last one was a long one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it.\
\
It started with \'93i,\'94 then \'93n,\'94 then \'93c.\'94 Next came an \'93o\'94 and an \'93n,\'94 followed by a \'93v,\'94 an \'93e,\'94 another \'93n,\'94 and an \'93i.\'94\
\
After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch.\
\
He read the \'93e,\'94 the \'93n,\'94 the \'93c,\'94 and at last the final \'93e,\'94 and staggered back into their arms.\
\
\'93I think,\'94 he murmured at last from deep within his corroding, rattling thorax, \'93I feel good about it.\'94\
\
The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever.\
\
Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings.\

\
Epilogue\
\
\
One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldn\'92t keep his mind on the job at hand.\
\
Brilliant?\
\
Certainly.\
\
One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other generation, including a number he had designed himself?\
\
Without a doubt.\
\
The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldn\'92t be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now.\
\
He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition.\
\
So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a distant star, who were still a fair way off but traveling fast, he, Blart Versenwald III (his name was Blart Versenwald III, which is not strictly relevant, but quite interesting because\'97never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why it\'92s interesting later), was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, \'93Concentrate!\'94\
\
So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of superfly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open half of a half-open window, and also an off switch for children. Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be short-lived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were landing. But, astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races were only on the rampage because they couldn\'92t cope with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald\'92s extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a program of cultural exchanges. And, in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned lived happily ever after.\
\
There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler\'92s mind.\

It Safe\
\
\
\
\
A large flying craft moved swiftly across the surface of an astoundingly beautiful sea. From mid-morning onward it plied back and forth in great widening arcs, and at last attracted the attention of the local islanders, a peaceful, sea-food-loving people who gathered on the beach and squinted up into the blinding sun, trying to see what was there.\
\
Any sophisticated knowledgeable person, who had knocked about, seen a few things, would probably have remarked on how much the craft looked like a filing cabinet\'97a large and recently burgled filing cabinet lying on its back with its drawers in the air and flying.\
\
The islanders, whose experience was of a different kind, were instead struck by how little it looked like a lobster.\
\
They chattered excitedly about its total lack of claws, its stiff unbending back, and the fact that it seemed to experience the greatest difficulty staying on the ground. This last feature seemed particularly funny to them. They jumped up and down on the spot a lot to demonstrate to the stupid thing that they themselves found staying on the ground the easiest thing in the world.\
\
But soon this entertainment began to pall for them. After all, since it was perfectly clear to them that the thing was not a lobster, and since their world was blessed with an abundance of things that were lobsters (a good half dozen of which were now marching succulently up the beach toward them), they saw no reason to waste any more time on the thing but decided instead to adjourn immediately for a late lobster lunch.\
\
At that exact moment the craft stopped suddenly in mid-air, then upended itself and plunged headlong into the ocean with a great crash of spray which sent them shouting into the trees.\
\
When they reemerged, nervously, a few minutes later, all they were able to see was a smoothly scarred circle of water and a few gulping bubbles.\
\
That\'92s odd, they said to each other between mouthfuls of the best lobster to be had anywhere in the Western Galaxy, that\'92s the second time that\'92s happened in a year.\
\
\
The craft which wasn\'92t a lobster dived direct to a depth of two hundred feet, and hung there in the heavy blueness, while vast masses of water swayed about it. High above, where the water was magically clear, a brilliant formation of fish flashed away. Below, where the light had difficulty reaching, the color of the water sank to a dark and savage blue.\
\
Here, at two hundred feet, the sun streamed feebly. A large, silk-skinned sea-mammal rolled idly by, inspecting the craft with a kind of half interest, as if it had half expected to find something of this kind around about here, and then it slid on up and away toward the rippling light.\
\
The craft waited for a minute or two, taking readings, and then descended another hundred feet. At this depth it was becoming seriously dark. After a moment or two the internal lights of the craft shut down, and in the second or so that passed before the main external beams suddenly stabbed out, the only visible light came from a small hazily illuminated pink sign which read The Beeblebrox Salvage and Really Wild Stuff Corporation.\
\
The huge beams switched downward, catching a vast shoal of silver fish, which swiveled away in silent panic.\
\
In the dim control room, which extended in a broad bow from the craft\'92s blunt prow, four heads were gathered around a computer display that was analyzing the very, very faint and intermittent signals that emanated from deep on the sea bed.\
\
\'93That\'92s it,\'94 said the owner of one of the heads finally.\
\
\'93Can we be quite sure?\'94 said the owner of another of the heads.\
\
\'93One hundred percent positive,\'94 replied the owner of the first head.\
\
\'93You\'92re one hundred percent positive that the ship which is crashed on the bottom of this ocean is the ship which you said you were one hundred percent positive could one hundred percent positively never crash?\'94 said the owner of the two remaining heads. \'93Hey,\'94 he put up two of his hands, \'93I\'92m only asking.\'94\
\
The two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration responded to this with a very cold stare, but the man with the odd, or rather the even, number of heads missed it. He flung himself back on the pilot couch, opened a couple of beers\'97one for himself and the other also for himself\'97stuck his feet on the console and said \'93Hey, baby\'94 through the ultra-glass at a passing fish.\
\
\'93Mr. Beeblebrox \'85\'94 began the shorter and less reassuring of the two officials in a low voice.\
\
\'93Yup?\'94 said Zaphod, rapping a suddenly empty can down on some of the more sensitive instruments. \'93You ready to dive? Let\'92s go.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Beeblebrox, let us make one thing perfectly clear \'85\'94\
\
\'93Yeah let\'92s,\'94 said Zaphod. \'93How about this for a start. Why don\'92t you just tell me what\'92s really on this ship.\'94\
\
\'93We have told you,\'94 said the official. \'93By-products.\'94\
\
Zaphod exchanged weary glances with himself.\
\
\'93By-products,\'94 he said. \'93By-products of what?\'94\
\
\'93Processes,\'94 said the official.\
\
\'93What processes?\'94\
\
\'93Processes that are perfectly safe.\'94\
\
\'93Santa Zarquana Voostra!\'94 exclaimed both of Zaphod\'92s heads in chorus. \'93So safe that you have to build a zarking fortress ship to take the byproducts to the nearest black hole and tip them in! Only it doesn\'92t get there because the pilot takes a detour\'97is this right?\'97to pick up some lobster \'85? OK, so the guy is cool, but \'85 I mean own up, this is barking time, this is major lunch, this is stool approaching critical mass, this is \'85 this is \'85 total vocabulary failure!\
\
\'93Shut up!\'94 his right head yelled at his left, \'93we\'92re flanging!\'94\
\
He got a good calming grip on the remaining beer can.\
\
\'93Listen, guys,\'94 he resumed after a moment\'92s peace and contemplation. The two officials had said nothing. Conversation at this level was not something to which they felt they could aspire. \'93I just want to know,\'94 insisted Zaphod, \'93what you\'92re getting me into here.\'94\
\
He stabbed a finger at the intermittent readings trickling over the computer screen. They meant nothing to him but he didn\'92t like the look of them at all. They were all squiggly with lots of long numbers and things.\
\
\'93It\'92s breaking up, is that it?\'94 he shouted. \'93It\'92s got a hold full of epsilonic radiating aorist rods or something that\'92ll fry this whole space sector for zillions of years back and it\'92s breaking up. Is that the story? Is that what we\'92re going down to find? Am I going to come out of that wreck with even more heads?\'94\
\
\'93It cannot possibly be a wreck, Mr. Beeblebrox,\'94 insisted the official, \'93the ship is guaranteed to be perfectly safe. It cannot possibly break up.\'94\
\
\'93Then why are you so keen to go and look at it?\'94\
\
\'93We like to look at things that are perfectly safe.\'94\
\
\'93Freeeooow!\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Beeblebrox,\'94 said the official, patiently, \'93may I remind you that you have a job to do?\'94\
\
\'93Yeah, well, maybe I don\'92t feel so keen on doing it all of a sudden. What do you think I am, completely without any moral whatsits, what are they called, those moral things?\'94\
\
\'93Scruples?\'94\
\
\'93Scruples, thank you, whatsoever? Well?\'94\
\
The two officials waited calmly. They coughed slightly to help pass the time.\
\
Zaphod sighed a \'93what is the world coming to\'94 sort of sigh to absolve himself from all blame, and swung himself around in his seat.\
\
\'93Ship?\'94 he called.\
\
\'93Yup?\'94 said the ship.\
\
\'93Do what I do.\'94\
\
The ship thought about this for a few milliseconds and then, after double checking all the seals on its heavy duty bulkheads, it began slowly, inexorably, in the hazy blaze of its lights, to sink to the lowest depths.\
\
Five hundred feet.\
\
A thousand.\
\
Two thousand.\
\
Here, at a pressure of nearly seventy atmospheres, in the chilling depths where no light reaches, nature keeps its most heated imaginings. Two foot-long nightmares loomed wildly into the bleaching light, yawned, and vanished back into the blackness.\
\
Two and a half thousand feet.\
\
At the dim edges of the ship\'92s lights guilty secrets flitted by with their eyes on stalks.\
\
Gradually the topography of the distantly approaching ocean bed resolved with greater and greater clarity on the computer displays until at last a shape could be made out that was separate and distinct from its surroundings. It was like a huge lopsided cylindrical fortress that widened sharply halfway along its length to accommodate the heavy ultraplating with which the crucial storage holds were clad, and which were supposed by its builders to have made this the most secure and impregnable spaceship ever built. Before launch the material structure of this section had been battered, rammed, blasted and subjected to every assault its builders knew it could withstand in order to demonstrate that it could withstand them.\
\
The tense silence in the cockpit tightened perceptibly as it became clear that it was this section that had broken rather neatly in two.\
\
\'93In fact it\'92s perfectly safe,\'94 said one of the officials, \'93it\'92s built so that even if the ship does break up, the storage holds cannot possibly be breached.\'94\
\
\
Three thousand, eight hundred and twenty-five feet.\
\
Four Hi-Presh-A Smart Suits moved slowly out of the open hatchway of the salvage craft and waded through the barrage of its lights toward the monstrous shape that loomed darkly out of the sea night. They moved with a sort of clumsy grace, near weightlessness though weighed on by a world of water.\
\
With his right-hand head Zaphod peered up into the black immensities above him and for a moment his mind sang with a silent roar of horror. He glanced to his left and was relieved to see that his other head was busy watching the Brockian Ultra-Cricket broadcasts on the helmet vid without concern. Slightly behind him to his left walked the two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration, slightly in front of him to his right walked the empty suit, carrying their implements and testing the way for them.\
\
They passed the huge rift in the broken backed Starship Billion Year Bunker, and played their flashlights up into it. Mangled machinery loomed between torn and twisted bulkheads, two feet thick. A family of large transparent eels lived in there now and seemed to like it.\
\
The empty suit preceded them along the length of the ship\'92s gigantic murky hull, trying the airlocks. The third one it tested ground open uneasily. They crowded inside it and waited for several long minutes while the pump mechanisms dealt with the hideous pressure that the ocean exerted, and slowly replaced it with an equally hideous pressure of air and inert gases. At last the inner door slid open and they were admitted to a dark outer holding area of the Starship Billion Year Bunker.\
\
Several more high security Titan-O-Hold doors had to be passed through, each of which the officials opened with a selection of quark keys. Soon they were so deep within the heavy security fields that the Ultra-Cricket broadcasts were beginning to fade, and Zaphod had to switch to one of the rock video stations, since there was nowhere that they were not able to reach.\
\
A final doorway slid open, and they emerged into a large sepulchral space. Zaphod played his flashlight against the opposite wall and it fell full on a wild-eyed screaming face.\
\
Zaphod screamed a diminished fifth himself, dropped his light and sat heavily on the floor, or rather on a body which had been lying there undisturbed for around six months and which reacted to being sat on by exploding with great violence. Zaphod wondered what to do about all this, and after a brief but hectic internal debate decided that passing out would be the very thing.\
\
He came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he was, where he was or how he had got there, but was not able to convince anybody. He then pretended that his memory suddenly returned with a rush and that the shock caused him to pass out again, but he was helped unwillingly to his feet by the empty suit\'97which he was beginning to take a serious dislike to\'97and forced to come to terms with his surroundings.\
\
They were dimly and fitfully lit and unpleasant in a number of respects, the most obvious of which was the colorful arrangement of parts of the ship\'92s late lamented Navigation Officer over the floor, walls and ceiling, and especially over the lower half of his, Zaphod\'92s, suit. The effect of this was so astoundingly nasty that we shall not be referring to it again at any point in this narrative\'97other than to record briefly the fact that it caused Zaphod to throw up inside his suit, which he therefore removed and swapped, after suitable headgear modifications, with the empty one. Unfortunately the stench of the fetid air in the ship, followed by the sight of his own suit walking around casually draped in rotting intestines was enough to make him throw up in the other suit as well, which was a problem that he and the suit would simply have to live with.\
\
There. All done. No more nastiness.\
\
At least, no more of that particular nastiness.\
\
The owner of the screaming face had calmed down very slightly now and was babbling away incoherently in a large tank of yellow liquid\'97an emergency suspension tank.\
\
\'93It was crazy,\'94 he babbled, \'93crazy! I told him we could always try the lobster on the way back, but he was crazy. Obsessed! Do you ever get like that about lobster? Because I don\'92t. Seems to me it\'92s all rubbery and fiddly to eat, and not that much taste, well I mean is there? I infinitely prefer scallops, and said so. Oh Zarquon, I said so!\'94\
\
Zaphod stared at this extraordinary apparition, flailing in its tank. The man was attached to all kinds of life-support tubes, and his voice was bubbling out of speakers that echoed insanely around the ship, returning as haunting echoes from deep and distant corridors.\
\
\'93That was where I went wrong,\'94 the madman yelled, \'93I actually said that I preferred scallops and he said it was because I hadn\'92t had real lobster like they did where his ancestors came from, which was here, and he\'92d prove it. He said it was no problem, he said the lobster here was worth a whole journey, let alone the small diversion it would take to get here, and he swore he could handle the ship in the atmosphere, but it was madness, madness!\'94 he screamed, and paused with his eyes rolling, as if the word had rung some kind of bell in his mind. \'93The ship went right out of control! I couldn\'92t believe what we were doing and just to prove a point about lobster which is really so overrated as a food, I\'92m sorry to go on about lobsters so much, I\'92ll try and stop in a minute, but they\'92ve been on my mind so much for the months I\'92ve been in this tank, can you imagine what it\'92s like to be stuck in a ship with the same guys for months eating junk food when all one guy will talk about is lobster and then spend six months floating by yourself in a tank thinking about it. I promise I will try and shut up about the lobsters, I really will. Lobsters, lobsters, lobsters\'97enough! I think I\'92m the only survivor. I\'92m the only one who managed to get to an emergency tank before we went down. I sent out the Mayday and then we hit. It\'92s a disaster, isn\'92t it? A total disaster, and all because the guy liked lobsters. How much sense am I making? It\'92s really hard for me to tell.\'94\
\
He gazed at them beseechingly, and his mind seemed to sway slowly back down to earth like a falling leaf. He blinked and looked at them oddly like a monkey peering at a strange fish. He scrabbled curiously with his wrinkled up fingers at the glass side of the tank. Tiny, thick yellow bubbles loosed themselves from his mouth and nose, caught briefly in his swab of hair and strayed on upward.\
\
\'93Oh Zarquon, oh heavens,\'94 he mumbled pathetically to himself, \'93I\'92ve been found. I\'92ve been rescued.\'85 \'93\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said one of the officials, briskly, \'93you\'92ve been found at least.\'94 He strode over to the main computer bank in the middle of the chamber and started checking quickly through the ship\'92s main monitor circuits for damage reports.\
\
\'93The aorist rod chambers are intact,\'94 he said.\
\
\'93Holy dingo\'92s dos,\'94 snarled Zaphod, \'93there are aorist rods on board \'85!\'94\
\
Aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of energy production. When the hunt for new sources of energy had at one point got particularly frantic, one bright young chap suddenly spotted that one place which had never used up all its available energy\'97the past. And with the sudden rush of blood to the head that such insights tend to induce, he invented a way of mining it that very same night, and within a year huge tracts of the past were being drained of all their energy and simply wasting away. Those who claimed that the past should be left unspoiled were accused of indulging in an extremely expensive form of sentimentality. The past provided a very cheap, plentiful and clean source of energy, there could always be a few Natural Past Reserves set up if anyone wanted to pay for their upkeep, and as for the claim that draining the past impoverished the present, well, maybe it did, slightly, but the effects were immeasurable and you really had to keep a sense of proportion.\
\
It was only when it was realized that the present really was being impoverished, and that the reason for it was that those selfish plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the same thing, that everyone realized that every single aorist rod, and the terrible secret of how they were made, would have to be utterly and forever destroyed. They claimed it was for the sake of their grandparents and grandchildren, but it was of course for the sake of their grandparent\'92s grandchildren, and their grandchildren\'92s grandparents.\
\
The official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration gave a dismissive shrug.\
\
\'93They\'92re perfectly safe,\'94 he said. He glanced up at Zaphod and suddenly said with uncharacteristic frankness, \'93There\'92s worse than that on board. At least,\'94 he added, tapping at one of the computer screens, \'93I hope it\'92s on board.\'94\
\
The other official rounded on him sharply.\
\
\'93What the hell do you think you\'92re saying?\'94 he snapped.\
\
The first shrugged again. He said, \'93It doesn\'92t matter. He can say what he likes. No one would believe him. It\'92s why we chose to use him rather than do anything official, isn\'92t it? The more wild the story he tells, the more it\'92ll sound like he\'92s some hippy adventurer making it up. He can even say that we said this and it\'92ll make him sound like a paranoid.\'94 He smiled pleasantly at Zaphod who was seething in his nasty suit. \'93You may accompany us,\'94 he told him, \'93if you wish.\'94\
\
\
\'93You see?\'94 said the official, examining the ultra-titanium outer seals of the aorist rod hold. \'93Perfectly secure, perfectly safe.\'94\
\
He said the same thing as they passed holds containing chemical weapons so powerful that a teaspoonful could fatally infect an entire planet.\
\
He said the same thing as they passed holds containing zeta-active compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could blow up a whole planet.\
\
He said the same thing as they passed holds containing theta-active compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could irradiate a whole planet.\
\
\'93I\'92m glad I\'92m not a planet,\'94 muttered Zaphod.\
\
\'93You\'92d have nothing to fear,\'94 assured the official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration, \'93planets are very safe. Provided,\'94 he added\'97and paused. They were approaching the hold nearest to the point where the back of the Starship Billion Year Bunker was broken. The corridor here was twisted and deformed, and the floor was damp and sticky in patches.\
\
\'93Ho hum,\'94 he said, \'93ho very much hum.\'94\
\
\'93What\'92s in this hold?\'94 demanded Zaphod.\
\
\'93By-products,\'94 said the official, clamming up again.\
\
\'93By-products \'85,\'94 insisted Zaphod, quietly, \'93of what?\'94\
\
Neither official answered. Instead, they examined the hold door very carefully and saw that its seals were twisted apart by the forces that had deformed the whole corridor. One of them touched the door lightly. It swung open to his touch. There was darkness inside, with just a couple of dim yellow lights deep within it.\
\
\'93Of what?\'94 hissed Zaphod.\
\
The leading official turned to the other.\
\
\'93There\'92s an escape capsule,\'94 he said, \'93that the crew were to use to abandon ship before jettisoning it into the black hole,\'94 he said. \'93I think it would be good to know that it\'92s still there.\'94 The other official nodded and left without a word.\
\
The first official quietly beckoned Zaphod in. The large dim yellow lights glowed about twenty feet from them.\
\
\'93The reason,\'94 he said, quietly, \'93why everything else in this ship is, I maintain, safe, is that no one is really crazy enough to use them. No one. At least no one that crazy would ever get near them. Anyone that mad or dangerous rings very deep alarm bells. People may be stupid but they\'92re not that stupid.\'94\
\
\'93By-products,\'94 hissed Zaphod again, he had to hiss in order that his voice shouldn\'92t be heard to tremble, \'93of what.\'94\
\
\'93Er, Designer People.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation was awarded a huge research grant to design and produce synthetic personalities to order. The results were uniformly disastrous. All the \'91people\'92 and \'91personalities\'92 turned out to be amalgams of characteristics that simply could not co-exist in naturally occurring life forms. Most of them were just poor pathetic misfits, but some were deeply, deeply dangerous. Dangerous because they didn\'92t ring alarm bells in other people. They could walk through situations the way that ghosts walk through walls, because no one spotted the danger.\
\
\'93The most dangerous of all were three identical ones\'97they were put in this hold, to be blasted, with this ship, right out of this universe. They are not evil, in fact they are rather simple and charming. But they are the most dangerous creatures that ever lived because there is nothing they will not do if allowed, and nothing they will not be allowed to do.\'85\'94\
\
Zaphod looked at the dim yellow lights, the two dim yellow lights. As his eyes became accustomed to the light he saw that the two lights framed a third space where something was broken. Wet sticky patches gleamed dully on the floor.\
\
Zaphod and the official walked cautiously toward the lights. At that moment, four words came crashing into the helmet headsets from the other official.\
\
\'93The capsule is gone,\'94 he said tersely.\
\
\'93Trace it,\'94 snapped Zaphod\'92s companion. \'93Find exactly where it has gone. We must know where it has gone!\'94\
\
Zaphod slid aside a large ground-glass door. Beyond it lay a tank full of thick yellow liquid, and floating in it was a man, a kindly looking man with lots of pleasant laugh lines around his face. He seemed to be floating quite contentedly and smiling to himself.\
\
Another terse message suddenly came through his helmet headset. The planet toward which the escape capsule had headed had already been identified. It was in Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.\
\
The kindly looking man in the tank seemed to be babbling gently to himself, just as the co-pilot had been in his tank. Little yellow bubbles beaded on the man\'92s lips. Zaphod found a small speaker by the tank and turned it on. He heard the man babbling gently about a shining city on a hill.\
\
He also heard the official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration issue instructions that the planet in ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha must be made \'93perfectly safe.\'94}
